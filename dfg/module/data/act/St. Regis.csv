Review
"Spent three nights at the St. Regis in San Francisco.  Had a corner suite with terrific views of the city and was well taken care of by the hotel staff.  The hotel’s location is ideal for museums, restaurants, shopping and more! Would definitely stay here again!!!!!"
"We stayed for a couple of days at the St Regis SF. As a Platinum SPG, they played the game and upgraded us in a better room that the one we booked. The Hotel is very central behind Market St and next to SF Museum of Modern Art/Yerba Buena : one of the rare walkable area in town. Building looks pretty new (great to know in case of quake...) and rooms are very well designed with different views on SF downtown. Very confortable bathroom and great bed. At international standards (higher that Californian ones) The Bar at the lobby is trendy too and perfect for a meeting or a late cocktail. Parking is pretty efficient (though expensive, like anywhere in SF) Breakfast is delivered on a small room in the back on the street. Nothing amazing but service was perfect. We enjoyed the experience and we will come back."
"Is it for the location? Is it for the accommodations? Is it for the security and safety of our loved ones? Is it for the staff being genuine, caring, helpful, smiling, always there to assist? Or do you choose a hotel from one of those cheap web sites just based on price and you do not care about your family’s safety, security or health? Our family has been staying at only the St. Regis for the past 2-1/2 years every time we are in the City. It is a fantastic location with close walking distance to great food and shopping, very safe and secure, extremely helpful staff, and they will accommodate any request.Filling out a number survey does not do justice to the hotel staff.  There are no words we can say that would truly express the staff. Dung, Tatiana, Sara and Brando are the most amazing, thoughtful, genuine, down to Earth people we have met at any hotel. From the kind and helpful Michael at the front door, to the amazing accommodations being arranged by Dung, to the great service to the room by Brando, to the amazing Tatiana and Sara who unpacked us in a professional and elegant way. I believe there is no finer hotel nor staff in San Francisco to assist you and your family.Here is my suggestion: Call or stop by. See for yourself how you are treated. Just walk in and look around. Ask for Dung at the front desk to show you their accommodations and room selection. Then you decide if you want a cheap hotel with breakfast that is days old in a plastic wrapper, with no one to assist you, poor if any security, and hard to find parking that is also unsecure.My family will always stay at the St. Regis. Yours should also. Try a complete lifestyle change."
Great hotel in a great location. The St Regis once again did not disappoint. Beautiful rooms and the staff is extremely attentive. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a superior hotel with excellent service. 
"I was recently at the St. Regis for a work conference. It happened to be the week end of the Chinese New Year. The front staff proactively left me a map and warnings about potential traffic problems.The hotel was spotlessly clean and the cleaning staff was friendly, quick and efficient. My room was spacious with a large tub and shower. I would definitely stay here again. The lobby bar was very busy with great energy."

"The St. Regis San Fran is outstanding!  Location is perfect, just South of Market, right next to the Museum of Modern Art, across the street from Yerba Buena, Metreon, and a short walk to all of the Union Square and Market Street shopping.  The hotel is modern and sophisticated, but also really comfortable and welcoming. We loved the fireplace that greets you on the other side of the front door, and the lobby bar is super chic with a lively scene.  We loved the indoor pool! This is a great amenity for a city hotel, especially when traveling with a family. The pool is warm and there are tons of windows and natural light. There's a poolside menu for food and beverages. Grill is the contemporary restaurant that serves seasonal dishes with locally sourced ingredients. We are gluten free and they do a fantastic job with this - lots of gluten free menu options and the gluten free bread was delicious.  We saw the beautiful house car (a Bentley), but our timing was off with it pulling away each time we were hoping to catch a ride (next time!).  We were in a Grand Deluxe Guest room on the 20th floor, and it was amazing.  Beautifully finished with high ceilings, big windows allowing for lots of natural light, plenty of space, huge shower, soaking tub, and amazing views over Yerba Buena.  My son said the roll away was one of the best he has ever slept in.  Can't wait to return to this hotel."
"We had a week long, fatastic family vacation at the St. Regis SF.  Upon arrival we were greeted with friendly faces and that warm welcome continued throughout our stay.  Every single member of the staff that we encountered (from houskeeping to management) was professional, friendly, kind and most knew our name.  The concierge and front desk staff remembered our names and faces from check in througout the week and always greeted us by name.  Impressive!  We had a some confusion with out room upon check in and it was resolved immediately and handled very well.  The handwritten welcome note upon arrival was lovely and appreciated.  Our rooms were quite clean.  Even our children noted  the deep corners of the rooms were clean (they played hide and seek in our connected rooms). We switched rooms throughout the week as we left for a night to take a trip to Carmel. Each room we stayed in was very clean.  The beds are quite comfortable.  The windows and views in the rooms are spectacular.  The motorized shades are a nice luxury if you want to fall asleep looking at the city skyline and don't want to have to hop out of bed to shut the windows once you are relaxed in your bed.  The spa massage was exceptional.  Our chidren enjoyed the 24 hour pool immensley!  Private dining delivered to the pool was especially convenient.  This hotel is not short on amenities and makes even the youngest guest feel special. Our children loved the kid sized bathrobes.   St. Regis SF  felt like a home away from home and we won't look anywhere else the next time we travel to SF.   It was tough to leave this lovely place."
"The St Regis San Francisco is unquestionably my favorite city hotel in the USA, and one of our 13 favorite hotels of all-time anywhere in the world.I stayed twice (both paid rates) at the St Regis San Francisco this year, once alone for work for 2 nights in mid-Nov 2017 and again for leisure this past mid-Dec 2017 weekend with my husband and our dog, Macallan. As with my three stays in 2016, my stays this year again were absolutely wonderful--approaching the same levels of service I've come to expect from the legendary Amanresort hotels. I am only now able to post this review from my Dec 2018 stay due to the 3 month rule in posting for hotel stays! The hotel lobby was beautifully decorated for Christmas on our Dec stay. The hotel is so supremely luxurious and yet so very comfortable. It offers the San Francisco sense of chic design and luxury while also retaining a casual comfort that so evokes California.That being said, the hotel is expecting to undergo a renovation starting sometime in late 2018 to freshen up and renovate the public spaces and rooms/suites. Check InCheck in was, as always, very friendly, quick, and efficient. There was no one checking in before me for my Nov stay, and in Dec there were two couples checking in before me. But I waited maybe no more than a few minutes. The Front Office Director and Head Concierge both were there to greet me, as well.  RoomThe Metropolitan Suite is extremely comfortable and spacious. I had the exact same Metropolitan Suite for both my Nov and Dec stays.The hotel had added blackout shades in the bedroom specifically for me in 2016--meaning the suite living room and bedroom were truly blackout! The air con again worked wonders, too.The suite is beautifully comfortable and spacious, and was particularly wonderful for my Dec stay with my husband and our dog, Macallan! The hotel did try to accommodate our big boy despite him being larger than their official 35 lb weight limit for dogs. Suffice to say that the St Regis dog bed wasn't quite big enough for our boy! But we were ecstatic that the St Regis allowed us to bring him, nonetheless.ServiceService for both stays was practically flawless. Before even arriving in Dec, the concierge had worked with me to get us confirmed with reservations at 2* Acquerello, 1* In Situ, 1* Luce, and 2* Lazy Bear. We eventually changed things up and substitued 1* Mourad for Luce and 3* Coi for Lazy Bear. The concierge team handled all our requests and changes with ease. Thus far, the concierge team has not once failed to get us a reservation that we wanted--even at any of the 2 * and 3* restaurants in the city.  That's a pretty impressive feat if you ask me.We had another delicious welcome amenity of cheese/crackers and fruit with champagne  waiting for us, as usual.In addition, I took advantage of unpacking and packing services. The butlers always do a wonderful job. One of the butlers was actually a transplant from the Ritz Carlton Reserve property in Puerto Rico, as that hotel will be closed through Oct 2018 due to Hurricane Maria. She was absolutely lovely and a wonderful addition to the St Regis team.I asked for complimentary butler shoe shines, and they returned the shoes to me in less than an hour:I enjoyed complimentary French press coffee service every morning. Sublime.We also had wonderful turndown service for both Nov and Dec stays. The only time turndown was missed was when I accidentally left the DND button lit by the front door! A quick call to the butler and the housekeeping team was there to turndown my room pronto--and with apologies that were unnecessary!We also enjoyed the complimentary Bentley car service for 2 of our 3 nights, prior to our dinners at Acquerello and Coi:The Bentley car service isn’t guaranteed; it’s first come, first served. But I’ve had great luck at getting drinks in the bar an hour or so before we want to depart and letting the valets know we are hoping for the Bentley. They’ve almost always come and found us in the bar close to when we wanted. A great benefit.The hotel even allowed us to bring Macallan into the bar with us--quite a nice surprise! They kept offering us water and treats for our most spoiled boy.Bar service was a little slow for us on our first night, so I mentioned it to the front desk. The bar manager introduced himself the next day and made sure to apologize--unnecessary but certainly appreciated. The next night, we got incredibly good service! There often was a bit of a wait for seating at the very popular bar between 6:00-8:00 pm, but I never waited more than 5 minutes to find seating on any night during our stays.Restaurant service was also extremely good. We had breakfast on our first morning and Sunday brunch on our final morning. The team even allowed us to order from the brunch menu despite having breakfast a good 30 min before the official start of brunch. And our breakfasts were comp'd as part of my Platinum amenity--even for brunch.Our one big hiccup with breakfast was the butler telling us during our Dec stay that the Sat breakfast service ended at 11:00 am--for us to arrive at 10:40 am and be told the breakfast service in fact closed at 10:30 am. The restaurant didn't handle that so well, but the front desk apologized when I complained--and offered for us to have room service breakfast comp'd as part of our Plat amenity. A very nice service recovery.That breakfast room service and room service dinner were always brought promptly (usually 20-25 min, always less than the stated 30 min) and hot. The server always set up the meal beautifully, as well. Both were delicious.Basically, the service at the St Regis is top drawer. The only mistakes I can recall are the mistake with the restaurant breakfast hours and the bar service being unusually slow that first night. That's it. And of course, the hotel's service recovery in those instances was wonderful. Otherwise, my stay was pretty much service perfection. The valets, butlers, front desk, concierge, waiters, bar staff, and everyone really went out of their way to make sure we were happy. Coming to the St Regis San Francisco for me is truly like coming home. DiningThe food and beverage here really does shine.We had breakfast in the restaurant on our first and last mornings. Sunday brunch was particularly enjoyable with some friends who joined us, too.For our second night, we wanted a break from the 1* In Situ, 2* Acqurello, and 3* Coi meals we otherwise were enjoying. So we had room service dinner to enjoy our suite. It was fantastic and easy, just as we'd hoped. My burger was great, but the salmon was really outstanding. We were a little nervous ordering salmon, which can so often be overcooked. Not this salmon! It was beautifully grilled to perfection. We were quite impressed.Our second morning we decided to do room service breakfast since the restaurant was about to close--though we'd be given the wrong closing time. The hotel graciously comp'd our room service breakfast as way of apology. It was delicious, again.Suffice to say that, even in a city with as many amazing food option as San Francisco, the St Regis delivers with gusto in its food and beverage options. LocationThe location of the St Regis is perfect for me.For business, it is easily accessed from the SFO and OAK airports and BART/Muni. Its SOMA location makes it very easy to walk or drive into Untion Square, the Financial district, or anywhere else in the city one might need to go.For leisure, it is literally adjacent to the SFMOMA museum and Metreon 16 complex (where we saw Star Wars: The Last Jedi on opening day). It is a 5-10 min walk to Union Square or to the Ferry Building or the entrance of Chinatown.It was just a 10-15 min drive in the Bentley to both Acquerello and to Coi. It was literally a 2 min walk to In Situ (inside the SFMOMA). And it took just about 20 min to drive to/from SFO. Perfection. OverallThe St Regis San Francisco is my true home away from home. There is no hotel that I visit more often that truly caters so well to my every luxury whim. The service, the rooms, the bar, the restaurant, the food/beverage, the concierge, the butlers, the restaurant--everyone and everything is truly world-class.While there were a few mistakes, the hotel showed tremendous service recovery in each instance, going well above and beyond to make us feel valued and appreciated. But for the most part, the service was ridiculously good...and always super friendly!We already cannot wait to return."
"This is my first time in San Francisco. The hotel has a good service and the room is very comfortable and spacious.The hotel location is centrally located and very near to shopping, museum etcetera.My first walk was down Market street toward the waterfront an the ferry terminal.I was appalled by the large number of homeless people and quite a few suffering from mental health issue.I witnessed passed out people on the side walk, a men urinating on steps of the subway entrance, an older women sitting down that smelled so bed to get you sick.Tonight on my way out to dinner, as I turned the corner on 3rd street, I was startled by a men screaming. After dinner, as I walked back to my hotel, a men jumped in front of me also screaming and chased by what seemed a security person.I got scared and walked back to the restaurant.This episodes left my self and my wife shaken and disappointed that the hotels around the area do not do more by providing more security for their guest outside their perimeter.San Francisco is a beautiful city, but the problem with the homeless which are mostly suffering from mental health leave an unsettling felling to visitors."
"We recently had a lovely two night stay in this beautiful 5 Star Hotel.  Staff was very friendly and helpful, and the hotel's location at 3rd and Mission is conveniently close to a number of excellent museums, including the brand new modern art.  We were upgraded to a suite, which doesn't have a coffee maker, but includes free coffee room service.  Nice touch!"
Short weekend stay (we live only one hour away but it is fun to get out in the city). Room was very large with beautiful large windows overlooking the SF MoMA and the city. The kids loved the pampering breakfast in bed (croissants were amazing). The staff couldn't be nicer to our little ones! Will definitely be back.
"It had been just over a year, since we last stayed at the St. Regis, at Mission & 3rd Streets, in San Francisco’s SoMa (South of Market) Area. My, how the time has flown. We were back, but for a very short stay this time. My wife’s typical meetings have moved a day, and with the current schedules, we have only been doing one night. She has half-day meetings on a Monday, then all day on Tuesday, and we fly home on Tuesday nights. This was just such a stay.We flew in early on Monday, and dropped her off at her corporate office, before I checked into the St. Regis. I was greeted by the doorman with a “Welcome back,” and the same for the young lady at the registration desk. Remember, this was our first stay, since early 2017, so about 13 months. Now, even when we stay elsewhere, I often use the Remède Spa in the St. Regis, so the front desk folk do see me fairly often. Same for the staff at the Lobby Bar, and also at the restaurant, Grill. Still, it is a very nice feeling, to get such a welcome, and from almost everyone on-staff. While dining on Monday evening at Grill, the bartender from the Lobby Bar stopped by the table, just to say hello, and welcome us back! We get similar treatment at the St. Regis, Washington DC, where we stay several times per year, but usually on a quarterly basis. This friendly recognition is a hallmark of the St. Regis properties, at which we have stayed.I was assigned room 1405, which is on the westside of the tower (the St. Regis is sort of bifurcated, in that it’s an older, historic building, with a more modern “tower” right behind. Over the years, we have stayed in many of the room types at the St. Regis, from smaller rooms, such as 1405, to several larger full-suites. Room 1405 is smaller, but very nicely appointed. It looks over 3rd Street, and across to the Yerba Buena Gardens, and the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, with the Moscone Center (major construction) just beyond. Being on the 14th floor, and on the northerly side of the building’s centerline, provided a nice view. We have stayed in similar rooms, on lower floors, which were on the southerly side of that centerline, and not had such a nice view, so that aspect was appreciated. Even given the location, above busy 3rd St, the room was very quiet, and we heard no sound from within the hotel.The room was very comfortable, with a King bed (very nice sleeping), a desk, small sitting area and a built-in “wall unit” with closets, drawers, a mini-bar and flat-screen TV. The separate bathroom has both a walk-in shower, and a soaking tub. The toilet is behind a frosted glass door. The bathroom has a single sink, but in a large vanity, so that one has plenty of horizontal space, with several small drawers and under-counter storage. It also came equipped with a full compliment of the Remède Spa amenities, and plush St. Regis towels – common at all of the St. Regis properties, where we have stayed. We had a hair dryer, which functioned well for my wife. There is one little “oddity” in the bathroom arrangement with many of the St. Regis San Francisco rooms, and 1405 had that – there is a window over the soaking tub, which opens into the bedroom When closed, the light from the bathroom does not intrude into the bedroom, but some noise will. When opened, the bathroom is filled with the light from the bedroom (especially if the blackout curtains are open), which brightens up the bathroom greatly. In general, the bathroom lighting is adequate, and there is a lighted vanity mirror on the wall.While the closet space is small (I had to remove the six padded hangers for adequate space), it was ideal for our clothing on this short trip. If one were staying a week, it might have proved too small? There was a horizontal safe, and iron & ironing board, and then a tray of more amenities. We had two plush terry bathrobes and then slippers, which came out, along with the amenity tray, during the turndown service. The St. Regis includes complementary overnight shoeshine services, but I did not take advantage of this, on our February stay.The mini-bar seemed well-stocked, but we did not take advantage of anything there.We had adequate AC outlets and USB ports, to charge all of our devices, and enough flat surfaces, that nothing had to hang from a wall outlet, or be placed on the floor.Our two windows had both sheers and blackout curtains, in a “Roman shade” configuration, and those are actuated by wall switches near the bed. Those worked perfectly. The “Do Not Disturb” sign is actuated by a switch, near the door. There is also a signal to “Make Up My Room,” but I did not use that. In the past, it has always worked well, to have the room serviced, while say at breakfast, or lunch – a real bonus, as at some hotels, housekeeping, and timing, can be an issue. At the St. Regis, one can basically “program” their desired schedule, and it is usually met.During this stay, we dined at Grill, just off of the lobby, and I had breakfast there, the next morning. Both meals were very good. I had plans to spend the afternoon, before our flight, at the Lobby Bar, exploring their always interesting (but short) B-T-G wine list, and catching up with the bartender, but plans changed. Instead of needing the 4:00pm, late check-out, I ended up rushing back to pack, to catch an earlier flight to return to Phoenix – the meetings ended early. Whether I stay at the St. Regis next trip, or not, I will stop into the Lobby Bar.Now, most of the St. Regis properties have one nice, and interesting “activity.” They do a 6:00pm “sabering” of a bottle of Champagne, in/near their lobbies. Unfortunately, for us, those are only on Thursday – Saturday nights, at this property, and we have never been at this St. Regis, on those nights. However, we have attended the event at most other St. Regis properties, and with some, several times. While short, it’s always a sight to see, and then, they pour complementary Champagne afterward. One trip, we will just come in early, or stay late!Now, the location is ideal for us. It is in the heart of the SoMa area, with proximity to Union Square, the Financial District, and the Embarcadero. It is also very close to Market St, and the entire MUNI transportation system. From the St. Regis, one is close to world-class dining, and shopping, and most of the popular sights around San Francisco, are just a bus, or streetcar ride away – or a lovely walk, on relatively flat streets. The Moscone Center is just a few blocks away, and the Yerba Buena Art Center, and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Contemporary Jewish Museum are within a block, or so. The Museum of the African Diaspora is actually off of the lobby of the hotel. Besides walking, and the MUNI, there are taxis around the St. Regis most of the day, and if none are there, the doormen are quick to summon one from 3rd St. There is also the “house Bentley,” for short trips from the hotel. While we did not use that on this stay, we have taken it to several restaurants within about a 1.5 mile radius (so many great restaurants within that distance!). The Bentley is on a “first-come-first-served” basis, with no reservations required, or taken. About all of the ride-sharing services are available too.In all, another great stay (19th ?) at the St. Regis San Francisco, and great reason to return, and return."
"I stay at the St Regis about 1x per year.  I love the rooms (which is why I keep coming back), the service is very good and the location is great.On the downside, I don’t much like the room service menu and don’t really love the dining options overall.  I find it annoying when a hotel can’t provide a coffee maker, since there’s no way I’m going to pay the exorbitant prices for a pot of coffee.  That means I need to head over to the Peet’s every morning. Last, the gym is ok, not great.  "
This is a classic old-school San Francisco hotel. It’s clean and nice and really classy and you feel important staying there and while it’s not a boutique hotel it’s actually pretty cool. Everybody who comes to San Francisco should stay there at least once
The St. Regis is a beautiful hotel in a central location.  The rooms are luxurious and well designed.  The bathroom was large and had amazing storage for a family of four. The mattresses and linens are super comfortable. The concierge provided excellent service.  Only negative would be the turn down service which either did not show up or came to the room too late. I will return to this city hotel on my next visit to SF.
"Stayed at the St. Regis San Francisco with my wife and two children (7, 1) in late December. Pleasure trip; second experience with SPG.Pros: Location, facilities, amenities, comfort, exclusivity, and staff. On the latter, this feels like being on a luxury cruise line. Everyone knows your name, remembers your preferences*, and is willing to tailor anything to ensure your (and your childrens’) satisfaction. Follow through to inquiries is consistent and personalized.Concerns: While attitude, graciousness, and helpfulness of the staff is great, many of our requests seemed to be lost in translation. Nothing major, but small things like requesting extra toiletries or a missing item, modifications to meals through room service or the restaurant downstairs; it felt as though each request which broke their foundational (and otherwise flawless) routine created disorganization and assumption. It was a very busy week for the hotel, so we’ll have to try again in a slower season.Great job overall, especially to the bar and restaurant staff!"
"When travelling for business, the thing you care most about is getting some sleep, being able to effectively work and having a functional room that takes all the friction and noise out of your day.  The St Regis delivered in spades.  Nothing too much trouble for the staff and excellent service on every interaction.  "
"Location: on the 13th Floor with great view of the Metreon, Yerba Buena center, Moscone center, Twin Peaks. It’s close to all that downtown has to offer - great central point for walking and exploration.Cleanliness: Room was clean, amenities such as pool area and gym was well maintained. ‘Service First’ Ambiance: For me, this is what sets St Regis apart from all of the other SPG properties. If you’re an SPG member and have had the opportunity to visit other Regis’ around the world - don’t expect consistency here.  Front desk has an “I told you so” attitude, which from experience during this stay seem to stem from how its Management runs the hotel’s customer service. For instance, it’ll make accommodations for certain issues but not before a statement like, “well next time, do this...” or “we have other guests to take care of” or similar back-handed comments.I recall in other St Regis properties, when we encountered certain issues - we were treated like loved family. Here, it’s hit and miss like an unwanted home Guests.For future guests, I hope your stay here is not like the one we had. I just wished we invested in another property of similar type where we’ve enjoyed before as we rarely get to San Francisco now. We will make the best of our stay but the front desk and Management of this hotel has left me with the notion that for future visits in any St Regis properties, not all are cut from the same cloth and to keep my expectations in check.If you don’t get that welcome letter before check in, or front desk doesn’t seem to embody the St Regis professionalism, it may be a representation of its poor management and customer service training lacking of the “know-how” of the St Regis “Service-first” way."
"The St Regis is great trendy hotel located near the Moscone Center and walking distance of everything in downtown SF. The rooms are nice, luxurious, modern and well designed. This was my third stay and I enjoyed it as much as the first. As with most St Regis hotels the level of service here is incredible. The bellmen and staff are considerate and eager to help with anything you need. We enjoyed drinks and snacks in the lobby bar and breakfast in the Grill. This is a top notch hotel and I plan on returning."
"This hotel is, quite simply, impeccable. The rooms are beautiful with all the amenities you could want - even the hair dryer was great!I always find the water pressure is large hotels to be somewhat of a let down, but didn’t mind this one.We actually experience an earthquake while staying here and felt very safe the whole time the building rocked. The staff were very kind and helpful, always smiling and willing to help with everything.The one thing I would change would be the inclusion of a buffet for breakfast. Instead they offer an a la carte menu at their restaurant, which was fine, but it’s always much nicer to pick and choose what you eat for breakfast.Will definitely recommend The St. Regis to anyone who asks!"
"I love this hotel - for accustomed travelers, a nicer bathroom means a lot and they did a wonderful job. Had in room dining a tone of times since the room was so comfortable and the food was so good. The bar is amazing and it’s a great location."
"The day conference ended I got email that the rate is $375 but during conference the rate for the same room is  $2300 per night-REALLY? So all the guests and companies that are paying this rate must be completely stupid? The room is horrible no place to sit , you get one chair at the desk that's it. Room service horrible, there is no coffee machine in the room, at least mandarin oriental gives that option for less than $2300X night. No privacy windows all exposed to the other rooms I could see other rooms in and they could see my room as well. Terrible heavy doors I had to fight to push it in and out of the rundown pockets. The sliding option is all broken. I had to lift it up and down. Lightning is horrible in the bathroom, shower door same fight heavy glass would not open I had to push it with all force. Terrible. The closet is super tiny enough for one coat that's it. And the bathtub stopper wouldn't close. The moment you are trying to fill up the tub water is draining down. I just didn't have time to bother asking them to fix it. Horrible. Never again. I gave extra star for the lobby. Horrible hotel with nice lobby and ripoff rates."
"I think my favorite part of the hotel was the hallway leading to the guest rooms. It featured dramatic lighting with wood veneer accents that I felt set the tone for a relaxed atmosphere. The room itself was well appointed with a very comfortable bed, soaking tub and separate shower with a rainforest shower head.  Somewhat of a minimalistic design that, in my opinion, could have been enhanced a bit to reflect the sophistication and zen feel of the hallways, but all in all I was comfortable.  The associates at the hotel were helpful, friendly and accommodating.  I enjoyed my visit, but given the property's price point, I'd have to say that I wasn't blown away enough to want to return on my own dime.  On the other hand, if your company picks up the tab, yeah, it's a hotel that I'd add to my list of places to stay in San Francisco."
"Rooms are nice but an incident earlier this year makes me think twice about staying here while I'm in the area.  Long story short they ""selectively"" decide which platinum members get upgrades in hopes that certain customers will pay for the upgraded rooms.  I was at the desk when another guest was upgraded to a suite after I asked for an upgrade and it was stated none was available.  It went as high as regional managers but they seemed not to care at all as I'm sure this is routine and they just sent a customary email to not acknowledge fault or take responsibility.I left a similar review on Yelp 3 months ago but have yet to hear from management.  Shows how much they value loyal guests."
"After staying at competitive properties often, I changed to the St. Regis for New Years weekend.  It was delightful -- festive, clean, good service and within walking distance of many haunts.  In the very near future the decor should be refreshed, especially touchups to furniture and upholstery.  Everyone was friendly and accommodating.  In my opinion, it is the best hotel in San Francisco - a cut above the competition."
"I am a lover of luxury hotels and have to say that this is my favorite hotel in all of San Francisco and all of the Bay Area.I stayed here on several occasions, but my review will be for August 2017, my 23rd birthday. My visits here were only in the Astor Suite and Metropolitan Suite, not the regular rooms. So for the Astor Suite...it contained one living area, a little nook with a desk, one bedroom, and a nice-sized bathroom. Smaller than the Metropolitan Suite, but it was good enough. I loved the floor to ceiling windows. I was also treated to a nice city view with partial view of the bay bridge. The Metropolitan Suite was much bigger. Bigger living area, bigger bedroom, a separate dining area, large windows for a lot of natural light to come in. The suites come with the St. Regis signature butler service. They were very professional, very friendly, and efficient. All of the staff--from the front desk, to housekeeping, to butlers, to restaurant servers--we're great people. I also ate at The Grill and had drinks at the Lobby Lounge. Both were great. Room service was quick and efficient.This will allways will be my favorite SF hotel."
"I was in for one night, speaking at an event which was also held at the hotel.  The staff is incredibly helpful, friendly, and super professional.  My room was beautiful- bed was very comfortable, bathroom was very large. Shower was great. Even bath products were very nice.  I'm usually freezing in my room, no matter what the thermostat says, but I was able to control the temperature in the room very well.  Soft towels, great morning coffee. walked all around the area - best shops!"
"We returned to St. Regis because we had a good experience during our last stay. This time we brought our dogs. Upon check-in, one of the staff noticed our dogs and asked if we would like dog amenities like bowls, treats, dog bed. I asked for a dog bed and when our luggage was being delivered, so was the dog bed. The rooms were exactly as we remembered. Clean and luxurious with a lovely view. There was a bit more wear and tear on this room than I remembered but I imagine that's to be expected. Housekeeping was great. They were generous with the complimentary bottled waters.I got to use this fitness center this time and it was replete with machines of all types. Really excited to use some equipment I don't normally use. Wished they offered water bottles in the fitness room but they have a dispensing water service. Cool find, they ""Love Over Rules"" public art light exhibit by Hank Willis Thomas can be seen from one of the fitness room window.Room service was quick and the entire staff was nice. We had a minor glitch when we extended our stay and one of the housekeeping staff thought we had left for the day and came to clean the room at night, but it wasn't a disturbance at all.As for our dogs, St. Regis is conveniently located a short walk to Yerba Buena Gardens which has plenty of space for dogs to roam. A little tip, Samovar Tea Lounge is on the top floor of Yerba Buena Gardens and you can bring your dog on their patio. On a sunny day, it's a really lovely place to sit and have a snack or tea.Hotel is well located, minutes from Union Square and tons of shopping and restaurants. We walked to the Ferry Building and all around, we enjoy strolling for hours but it may be too far for some to walk. Enjoyed our stay and experience."
"I splurged for amazing stay for 2 nights at St Regis.  Bedroom stunning with beautiful deep tub and separate shower,  luxurious bed and top level service.  Hotel has 24 hour salt water 2 lane swimming pool. The bar was friendly and great cocktails. I was nursing a terrible cold and hot toddy's for perfection. Enjoy great breakfast with attentive service.  I needed assistance shipping bag back East and taken care of immediately. Butler service top.  Room service dining good and did not take forever.  This is truly 5 star.  I enjoyed being right next to the SF Modern Museum of Art and easy walk to shopping at Union Square."
"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay and visit to San Francisco. The service was amazing - Asian standard. The room was more than decent as expected but the chaise lounge doesn't seem to have been cleaned for a while as there were stains on it. It sends a not so great perception sometimes. I would never sit on the other chairs in the room without laying a towel over after seeing those stains. But that's just me. The bathroom is very clean but I did have to request for them to clean the bath tub for the first use. The location is fantastic just beside SF MoMA and a lot of eateries in the area. Everything is pretty much walking distance. If I were to visit again, it'll still be my first choice. "
"I was locked out of my room twice; interrogated by security; was not able to accommodate one of my guests hotel needs; was charged for incidentals that were supposed to be included; never met my butler; and was not able to coordinate the pre-planned music for our 50th Anniversary with the entrance of our Grammy Award winning musical guest - it seemed that everything  that could go wrong - went wrong with the exception of the Catering. All this in spite of the fact that I came a day early to get things in order.I reserved 2 Metropolitan Suites and a third room to accommodate our special guests for a reception we were hosting to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of Westside Community Services. I chose this hotel because I am an SPG Platinum Member.  I came down a day ahead of the check-in process to pay in advance for our suites and explain the set up of the rooms. This was the first catastrophe and the manager that tried to help me insisted that I would need to move Malik Yoba (Empire, Designated Survivor, Cool Runnings, New York Undercover...) hours after he'd already checked in after flying from filming a movie in South Korea~ to another suite to accommodate my original requests. While I was running around trying to figure out where our guests from the 49ers would be situated (since Malik was in the suite that had the adjoining room that we'd reserved for the 49ers) my staff alerted me that the music that we brought to be played during our reception could not be played because the AV Department did not have the equipment to plug our iPhone 7 into their system. This is unbelievable since the 7 is at least two generations behind the newest iPhone and we were instructed that the music could be played via iPhone, laptop or iPod). We came with an iPhone and a Mac Pro and nothing could be done. The good news is that we were able to get an extra room at the W but jeez this was way too much stress for an evening that we planned for a year."
"Stayed for business. Pros:-Great location in SOMA, and easily accessible to FiDi / rest of the city-Modern, clean design throughout the property . . . one of my favorite StR designs globally-Great service per the brand-Strong SPG recognition (suite upgrade without using an upgrade award)-Rooms are large / designed wellDid not make use of gym or breakfast, so, unfortunately cannot comment. No real cons to mention. Would prioritize when going for business or pleasure."
"My family had a wonderful time at this property in their metropolitan suite. Front desk receptionist Christian and Sharon were very helpful in making sure that my room gets a high floor view after learning that my son is turning 2 that weekend. The bell and door team were extremely helpful and attentive as I made a few trips in to unload items for my son's surprise setup.We ordered from in room dining a couple times during our stay and Del was very welcoming and gracious. He brought a pear chocolate cake, which was set up by the head butler Pavel, up to the room knowing we're celebrating our son's birthday.The butler team was also very attentive and helpful! Morning coffee and tea service were timely and served with perfection. They also made sure that all of my needs were met from glasses and ice for my champagne to dental kit request at 4 in the morning!Housekeeping team also did a fantastic job with daily cleaning and turn down service. Even with our guests in the room, the staff member was able to do a fantastic job maneuvering around to finish her work. Overall, this property has an exceptional team that took well care of their guests. Everyone worked from their hearts to truly made my family and I felt like we're well cared for during our time here."
"I got home just yesterday from my latest 2 night stay at the StR SF. Another amazing stay. The only thing that went wrong was my morning coffee served by the butlers my first morning did not come with hot milk as I’d asked. That’s it.Otherwise, my stay was flawless.Had wonderful room service breakfast twice and dinner once. My Metropolitan Suite upgrade assured me of my blackout shades in my preferred suite location, as well as incredibly good air con as mentioned in the previous post. I had great service in the beautiful and comfortable bar both nights, and never had to wait to find a seat. I also ordered dinner at the bar.as well as wonderful drinks with a friend last night. Our bartender, Erick, was hilarious and fabulously funny. Valets had my car ready and waiting very quickly every day, and they almost always greeted me by name. I didn’t use butler services as much as I usually do, foregoing packing and unpacking since I only had a small carry-on, but they brought me morning coffee both mornings, answered the phone for all of my requests, shined my shoes, pressed a pair of pants, and followed up to make sure I was happy. The GM and Guest Relations Manager greeted me on arrival at the hotel, and the Chief butler made sure to say hello, as well. I also stopped by the concierge desk to confirm details for our next stay in a month—and as always, everything was taken care of without issue.There’s a reason this is my favorite city hotel in the USA. This is unquestionably the best hotel in San Frandisco, particularly so if you have any Starwood status. It’s SOMA location is perfect, too."
"Lux dark and contempo. Lovely fun bar lobby, suite was comfy. Delish catering. Hotel has fit ctr but also pool, unusual in san fran. Very nice attentive staff. Oasis in city. The suite was hosted by dreamfirce client. Furnishings were clubby and old world. Fekt east coasty"
Amazing ambiance and lobby bar area is a great place for executives to hang out.  Presidential suite was very nice and views are ok for where you are in the city.  Service staff and overall hotel staff are always ready to serve. 
"Our AMX travel rep recommended the St REGIS in SF.  The service throughout the hotel was very good, especially at the front desk and at the door.  We had a corner suite with excellent views, there was no turndown service the first night, mold in the shower and no hot water in the sink taps.  Reported the two issues on the way out to dinner the first night but nothing was done....shame on St Regis.  Great location, friendly staff but missing that wow factor."
"I’m platinum SPG Ambassador (100+ nights) and received an upgrade.  But the room was still small.  The walls of the room are empty (no paintings).  The one tv is so small and way across the room.  Turn down service is basic and not standard (eg closing all the blinds for you at night).  I was there for a series of meetings and the furniture was well worn.Wifi wouldn’t work in the restaurant.  Lobby is very small and crammed. I asked about using the Bentley served for tomorrow because I have to move to the westin St. Francis and was told I should just Uber?My other colleagues all agreed that the property is a disappointment and not up to the St. Regis standards. If you are used to the NYC or Rome properties, this is not like it.It’s a shame.  I was really looking forward to it. :("
"First of all let me state that this hotel is not in a great area. The hotel is right next to one of the most dangerous parts of San Fran. I definitely would not walk alone after dark. When we arrived no one greeted us or welcomed us to the hotel. The hotel is actually so busy I’m pretty sure 90% if the people in the lobby weren’t even hotel guests. From the very start there was an incredibly impersonal feel to this hotel.Room was spacious but definitely showed signs of wear and tear. Very luxurious, and the bathroom was by far our favorite part. There was butler service via an iPad (which also controlled the lighting and windows), but we never ordered anything. The air con didn’t go below 75 degrees which was actually quiet annoying. We would have liked it colder. The area is also very loud so if you are a light sleeper you’re forewarned. Lots of partying and late night scenes. Amenities are standard. They did offer a complimentary ride in the house Bentley it came with a laundry list of stipulations so we were never able to have a ride.Overall I think this hotel was nice but far over priced and very impersonal."
"My family of four including 2 toddlers traveled to SF for work and a family wedding. We selected this hotel because of its location, heated indoor pool for the kids, and adjourning bedrooms. We were not disappointed. The staff is very welcoming and friendly. At check-in, my toddlers were given teddy bears to keep them company during their stay. Super cute! Service is excellent. The gym and spa are both small and pretty standard. TIP-If you're traveling with family and need more than 1 bedroom, ask for adjourning bedrooms."
"I’ve been staying in this hotel for 3 nights. Second time in one year. Simply elegant, beautiful , new rooms. The staff is extremely nice and vero well trained. Food in general is quite good. Reality meet the expectation and the price is worth. Bravo "
A warm welcome awaited with one of the best team of concierge staff i have met.Great and plenty recommendations.The rooms are well maintained and serviced.The pool is a great addition and opens 24hrs which was great considering my jet lag.i also had a spa and massage which was very good.My only disappointment was the quality and choice at breakfast-average against a otherwise excellent hotel.
"The St-Regis is a superb hotel well situated (close to the SF MOMA).  The rooms are big and with lots of luxuries.  The service is high class.But the windows are thin so you can really hear the street.  So if you're a light sleeper like me, it may not be the right hotel for you."
"I have stayed here for abusiness a few times and have enjoyed it. The service is wonderful, if a bit stiff sometimes, and elegant.The rooms are well laid out, roomy and pleasant. It is located close to downtown, Moscone Cenvention, SFMOMA, and walking distance to many restaurants and other museums. Across the street is Yerba Buena Park which is lovely to stroll in on a nice day. Sometimes there are musicians playing and it's great to eat lunch, or relax for a bit, sit back, and enjoy the moment."
"It was so nice to be back here- even 3 years later it's still very well maintained both the rooms and the public areas. The downstairs Asian restaurant is now a grill and open most hours of the day with changing and interesting menus to well serve a number of different palates. The food was absolutely outstanding - fresh, high quality produce and seasoned in an international and sophisticated way. We did eat a number of meals there it was so good. Ambience is perhaps a little formal but the personable service and attentive waiting staff don't let that become in any way imposing. Every single staff member seems to be trained to the highest calibre which we have encountered only in the very best hotels around Asia an Europe and it just oozes sophistication in this and every other level. If I could change one thing it would be to make the heating more effective in the rooms especially the larger suites with high ceilings because of the often cooler SF climate. Also one time I ordered the same dish ( fish n chips ) in the room that I'd had a few times downstairs and it was not up to the same level- fish was kid size portion and not as fresh - this was the only thing of our entire stay . Love the beautifully equipped gym with relax area and stocked up drinks and the pool is still open 24/7 which is such a cool feature even if we didn't end up using it. I only wish this hotel and all it's amazing staff was closer to home! "
"A weekend away from home in the lap of luxury probably best describes this experience. From the moment we checked in to the time we departed, we were treated as though our business was the most important thing of all. The hotel went out of its way to delight—rather than just satisfy—our desires.Since we arrived late on Friday, we dined at the Grill, the St. Regis' restaurant. Our expectations were tempered by the fact that we were in the hotel. But, as with virtually everything else during the weekend, our expectations were blown away.The service was first rate—as you would, of course, expect. But it wasn't sneering luxury, it was respectful, courteous service. I couldn't decide on a wine? No problem! The waiter brought both bottles for me to try! When we asked for entree recommendations, instead of pointing us to the most expensive items on the menu, we were shown dishes that appealed to the waiter. There was no shoving the most expensive items on the menu at us for the sake of padding the bill.The appetizers were perfect for us, prepared beautifully...and fortunately the amuse bouche, a small beignet containing artichoke, was the ideal starting gun for our salivary glands. We needed to be rolled away from the table when we finally finished dessert.Our room, a beautiful suite on the 20th floor, overlooked the city. We had a beautiful, contemporary asian-themed room. Sleek, comfortable, a great bed with beautiful sheets and comforter kept us warm. The bathroom was spacious, and the toiletry amenities were lovely.The next two days we spent little time in the hotel and instead explored the City by the Bay. We went to SF Ooma—the outstanding contemporary art museum located right next door to the hotel. We walked to and from the Ferry building, maybe a mile away. And we relied on Uber to get us everywhere else. On our second night the hotel car, a silver Bentley sedan, was available to take us to our restaurant as part of the complimentary service of the hotel. The Bentley ride was worth it for the sheer luxury of the experience!Leaving was tough. When you've been pampered all weekend long, to turn your back on the place seems like a pretty sad thing. But these are all first world problems which we are fortunate to have! Thanks for an amazing stay. As Douglas MacArthur once said about the Philippines, and I'll paraphrase here: ""We shall return!"""
The room was beautiful.  Very spacious bedroom and washroom.  Everything was very upscale and clean.  Breakfast in the hotel was very tasty.  Good location as well.  Would stay here again.  It was a tad expensive but I'm glad we booked it.
"love this hotel. from the elegant décor, spacious room, great service, perfect location. it was all great.we really enjoyed staying here. great lobby lounge/bar. we enjoyed relaxing with a cocktail after a long day of trucking around the city. also before or after an evening out.we stayed over the Thanksgiving holiday. the xmas décor was lovely.we will def stay here again."
"What can I say it is the St Regis. This is a newer building and everything is done with taste and thought. From driving up to walking into check in, to your room. Decor: Very contemporary, but comfortable. Unlike the W which goes for modern mostly the St. Regis San Francisco keeps it clean and contemporary yet tasteful and comfortable. Great earth tone colors and tasteful art through out the building. Food: They have a lobby lounge which is great for just hanging out, having a meeting, or wanting to have a little snack. Nice atmosphere not too quiet, not too loud. They have Art of Tea which is served daily between 2-4pm and reservation are recommended, and finally their restaurant the Grill which is a contemporary dining. Beautiful dishes, great tastes and really if you just want a nice dinner without leaving the hotel you really can't go wrong, but again you are in San Francisco.. Rooms: Well the rooms as I said are amazing. Very clean, very contemporary but comfortable. huge windows allow you to see amazing views of the city and parks. Everything is automated, the bathrooms are large and comfortable. If you like the finer things in life, or want to take your partner on a romantic night this is it. Staff: Again A+ the entire experience was amazing including their staff. The butler service was on point and I really have zero complaints.. A+"
Spent 2 glorious nights with my Cousin at this beautiful elegant hotel. Birthday celebration treat for myself. The room was spacious very clean with comfortable beds. I enjoyed my room service for breakfast each morning the staff really are passionate and endearing.Checking in and out was outstanding and the concierge are the best. I enjoyed a little to much of the honeycomb at the front desk made from their own bees. The service from the bar I couldn't fault. I will be back next year. 
"I've stayed at the St. Regis SF (SRSF) ~20 times over the past few years and wanted to finally post a brief write-up for readers. Room: This week I stayed in #611 which is an Astor Suite room. This was a nice upgrade to the original room I booked and it's worth noting that as a loyal SPG member (SPG Platinum 100) I've had great experience getting suite upgrades at SRSF. ADining: I had 2 business meals at The Grill during my stay (breakfast and lunch) and both meals were very good. For breakfast, I had eggs scrambled with cheddar (just firm enough with a perfect amount of cheese), chocolate croissant (small/light) and delicious coffee. For lunch I had an excellent burger cooked medium (as requested), very good fries and an Arnold Palmer. I finished lunch with a cappuccino which was a little underwhelming and too foamy. Service: As has been the case for every one of my stays at SRSF the staff was absolutely great and a big part of why I always come back (as opposed to going to the Four Seasons a block away). The front desk checked me in early and upgraded my room without asking and also delivered my package very quickly, butler service promptly pressed my shirts, housekeeping came when requested and the The Grill dining staff was flawless and attentive. I did not use the Conceirge but did receive a handwritten note and business card from them and my past interactions have always been great. Overall the SRSF maintains an incredibly consistent/high level of service across accommodations, dining, staff service and SPG benefits. While on one hand you expect great service and accommodations it is worth noting the remarkable/repeated quality and consistency at SRSF. "
"Where do I begin!? From the moment we arrived at check-in, I knew we were in the right place! The greeting from the concierge to the bellman handing us off to our private butler. It was pure luxury. On some mornings, I just KNEW they had a camera, because as soon as we walked out the door or were  thinking about going out, our butler was RIGHT THERE to assist with anything we needed. They made dinner reservations at our beloved Crustaceans, scheduled a tour of our favorite vodka distillery in the Oakland area; Hanger One, and made certain we knew where we were traveling in the city. This hotel is in THE perfect location. Just PERFECT! The hotel lobby was a ""class act""! Having cocktails ""fireside"" was nice. It was an upscale feeling without feeling too snobbish. The drinks, food and service were  TOP NOTCH throughout the hotel. We will definitely return and I highly recommend this St. Regis."
"The room was well appointed (though there were spill spots on the marble ledge by the window where we stayed). The sheets and pillows were nice and comfy, not sagging. The room in general was clean. The amenities were good as well. It would have been perfect until it was ruined on our last day at the hotel. We asked for a late check out due to a late business meet by my husband and ""Marie"" from the front desk accommodated this. We left the hotel early morning to soak in the sights and sounds of SF before we finally leave. It would have been a nice ending to our SF visit until we came back to the hotel at around 12pm: our keycards do not work anymore. I called the front desk and the girl said "" we will send Jeff to activate your cards."" But Jeff did not activate the card. He went there like we were some kind of intruders and not guests and ask us to identify our belongings and if I have an ID. Though he apologized, but we felt that there should have been a better way to do his job without offending the guests.This is the first time we were treated that way in a luxury hotel. First of all this incident should not have happened if ""Marie"" ensured that our keys will still work beyond the regular check out time during our phone conversation or she could have just simply said "" don't forget to stop by the front desk to ensure that our cards are still active beyond 12pm so we would not be locked out."" We are SPG members and this is something not acceptable. If The Palace will be available next time we are in SF, we would definitely just stay there instead of St. Regis. At least there, we are really treated as guests."
Indulge your self with the best stay in town plus you're close by Union Square and most of the shopping malls.Most of the boutiques is around the corner and the memorable dinning experience plus the speciality coffee and the third wave is all around you so enjoy.
"I love to stay at the St Regis! They always think of what your needs may be (and the needs you may not have even thought of). After a long day i love  to come ""home"" start the fireplace, draw a bath, and bath while enjoying soft music and a glass of champagne. The sheets soft and bed makes you feel as though you are sleeping on a cloud. If you are in need of a little company you can venture downstairs and sit at or in the bar area. All the staff are friendly and give you the right level of interaction that you may want. Food top notch as well. "
"We split our stay in San Francisco with 2 nights at the Ritz, 3 nights in Napa and then 2 nights at the St. Regis. The concierge service was really good - Alexandre Rojon was fantastic in helping us get reservations for all four nights of our trip and making sure we had everything in our room upon arriving.  The front desk brought us glasses of champagne as it was our anniversary trip.  I had booked the hotel using our Starwood points for a jr suite upon arriving we found out we could upgrade to a suite twice the size with Bulter service for $250 a night YES! The butler service comes with your own butler who can help you unpack, brings you tea or coffee whenever you want at no charge, presses 2 articles of clothing for each person per day and shoe shines - all of which we used.  The front desk agent, Dung Tran, followed up with us after check in to see if we needed anything and when I mentioned it was our 30th Anniversary and the room was great he was happy to hear it. When we returned from Dinner we were happy to see that Mr Tran had arranged for white rose petals to be put on the bed and bathtub to make sure the room was as romantic as possible. We enjoyed our stay there and I was glad we had come as I had stayed here 3 years before and really enjoyed it. The only reason this review isn't excellent is due to their breakfast. Breakfast is served in their dining room - table service. We arrived at 10:20 thinking breakfast was served until 11 as were told on the phone - it actually was 10:30 we learned the next day when we almost didn't get entry as the hostess was insistent we could not be seated as it was 10:33 - even though she had seated people right before us. It was only due to the fact the waiter from our first day Kane stepped in to bring us to the table that we were allowed to dine. For a luxury hotel, the hostess should have found a way to help us instead of looking at her watch.  The food itself was fine -nothing special - and only due to Kane's service was enjoyable. It's unfortunate that the breakfast spoiled what was otherwise a great stay. Note this is right next door to the Museum of Modern Art which is CLOSED ON WEDNESDAYS!"
"Second visit! loved it as much as the time before...I think the location is pretty good..right next door to THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART...walking distance to all the great shopping..(upscale stores liked GUCCI , SAINT LAURENT)."
"The hotel was clean, modern and the staff very attentive. The hotel is in a great location and the room was very comfortable. We were surprised there were no coffee making facilities in our room although it was lovely to find milk and cookies for our son waiting at the end of our first day. The breakfast was table service and this was very slow. The breakfast room was very cold and depressing in atmosphere.  We took breakfast in or room on subsequent days. The pool was good and very bright. Although we were surprised to find no changing area by the pool. When we left the hotel the bellman came out with extra bottle of water for us in the car. Very thoughtful. "
"Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights with my girlfriend( who owns a residence there), then for 3 nights when my husband joined for the latter part of our stay.Her place on the 21st floor is STUNNING!, I then moved to the hotel part when our girls getaway and hubby joined me for a romantic getaway ( sans kids)The hotel is lovely, room service excellent. What really struck me most about the hotel is that not only is the lobby visually stunning, but the food is actually delicious!We took the hotel car to Nopa and to Salt House for dinners out also.   I would def. recommend this hotel, everything was flawless. Thank you !"

"This hotel is situated perfectly near Market St. - and is close to pretty much anything you need in SF. It's my hotel of choice while in SF, as they always are wonderful on service and go the extra mile to make your stay seamless. I prefer the corner suites (Astor Suites), which give nice views and plenty of space to work + entertain people. The room service is excellent, as well as the spa.If you're in SF, stay here!"
"We arrived Monday mid afternoon after a trip down from Napa.  We were greeted by the most pleasant, helpful staff who sincerely wanted to please us.  Since this was a special occasion, we decided to upgrade to a 1,000 sq. foot room that was stunning and had a butler service.  The hotel went above and beyond the call of duty with complimentary champagne, white rose petals (in the shape of a heart) on the bed and additional roses petals around the large two-person bathroom.  They even went out and got my wife medicine when my wife felt ill while we were packing to leave.  Bravo.The butler service was impeccable (thank you Miriam; I believe that was your name).  You can order anything, anytime--coffee, tea, shoe shine, etc..  A special thank you to Kane in the breakfast restaurant who got us in when we arrived three minutes after closing.  He attended to all of our needs and was so graceful and attentive.  He is a true asset to the hotel.Our room had a large living room, a good-sized bedroom and a wonderfully large bathroom with two sinks, a bathtub for two and a rainfall showerhead shower.  Our view was wonderful, overlooking the S.F. Museum of Modern of Art and the south of S.F.  You could see for miles.  The window shades are motorized to darken the room when you want.  Very cool.I highly recommend this world-class hotel.  The rooms are very modern (which I really loved), so if you are looking for something with an older style, you might want to think of another hotel.  That being said, of all of the hotels that I have stayed in the U.S., Canada and Europe, the St. Regis, San Francisco experience was the best by far."
"We have occasion to stay at really nice Hotels and Resorts from time to time. We stayed at the St Regis recently and had a visit worth reviewing. The Hotel is just 2 blocks away from Union Square, in an location abutted by SF's MOMA.It has a modern motif, and a compact check in and Bar area.Our visit was for 3 nights, and was made memorable by the PEOPLE who work at this hotel. Christian, Imelda, Pierre, and ALL the Staff made an impression. They actually LIKE their jobs. Its not hard to ascertain. The rooms are well appointed and have great beds. The controls for the lighting, drapes and controls are all digital and easy to manipulate. We've NEVER had a room cleaned as thoroughly as our was. Our loose LAUNDRY was folded. Ill not run on and on and am not normally a person who elaborates like this, but this SPG Hotel is worth a visit. Glitch free and running with big city smoothness. Nice Job St Regis!MahaloSteve Maratta"
"I had the spa treatment I've ever had this hotel. Treatment was called the San Francisco Spa and I highly recommend it. They dont just give you a message, it is a process. Hot stones, massage, warm water treatments, scrubs..its incredible!The service in general by the staff at this hotel is very nice. The staff is very respectful and aims to please."
"Our family of 4 stayed for three nights to tour the San Francisco area.  The hotel is very conveniently located, a short walk to the Ferry Building Marketplace and leads to a nice walk along the Embarcadero to the Fisherman's Wharf connecting all the attractions along the pier.  The hotel was clean and well appointed and service generally was very good.  They offer a nice turn down service with bottles of water for your room which is always appreciated.  We gave it only 4 stars because: - we were not offered the connecting room which we booked 6 months in advance for our two kids - we were told to evacuate the hotel at 3am due to a fire alarm.  Annoying as it may have been, this was not the hotel's fault as the fire alarm got triggered BUT they could have had more staff to direct people back inside the hotel when it was discovered to be a false alarm.  Not a single hotel staff came around to the exit door to the rear of the hotel to help guests in their bathrobes leaving to advise.  All the guests were milling around and slowly made back to the hotel foyer only to be told then, that it was a false alarm.  This alone should have dealt them a 1 star!  The hotel could have had better plans in place to deal with these issues and they appeared not to have well trained staff to deal with fire alarms."
This is a beautiful hotel but the best part was the incredibly friendly staff that greeted you and made you feel welcome. The staff is warm and friendly but professional. The rooms are very comfortable and the housekeeping was very good. We even received a hand written thank you note from our housekeeper our first day for a tip we left. Breakfast was incredible and I'm glad it was included as an amenity for being a Platinum member because it was expensive. The restaurant manager was a very pleasant young man who came and greeted us every morning. I will definitely stay in this hotel again. 
"Modern, comfortable and perfectly located (next to SF MOMA, Moscone Convention Center and Market Street) unit from the most luxurious brand of the Starwood empire. Try the rooms on the upper floors. Rooms are large, full of light and the bathrooms have all you need. Congratulations for a comfortable and efficient businesse center. Pool and spa are as expected. Grill and bar at the ground floor are nice options at the end of a city trip. Wine list much too expensive however, at the Grill.Spcial mention for Mariah Zuefle-Newman, Concierge Les Cles d'Or USA who can transforn any wish into reality"
"This was my second stay at the St. Regis and, once again, I was not disappointed with the level of service and quality of the room and amenities.  From the moment I arrived until the time I left, every hotel employee greeted me warmly and wanted to know how they could make my stay better.  The room was well appointed, with a very comfortable and luxurious bed, so I got a good night's sleep both nights of my stay.  The location of the hotel is also very central for most any part of the city one might to get to for business purposes, which is an added benefit."
"We loved this hotel during our honeymoon, the rooms are great, it has a great location and service is perfect. I would stay here again if I go back to San Francisco. We loved our room, and the bathroom has like a sliding door that was very cool"
"My wife and I stopped off in San Francisco for a night on way back to Australia after a weeks business trip in The US. We picked the St Regis based on some internet  searches. It was simply outstanding and as someone who travels constantly for business this was a great hotel. My personal preference is for hotels that are functional and warm and and not over the top or too flashy and modern. St Regis is a perfect balance.The service was exceptional, the rooms are stylish, very functional and yet understated (not flashy), beds, bathroom and internet all great. The concierge was so helpful both in booking restaurants for us and in chasing up some packages we had coming to the hotel. If you like swimming there is a great lap pool. The food in ""the grill"" is exceptional as well. Try the omelette of the day.It is perfectly located close to union square and the wharf area and the financial district. I have no hesitation on recommending the hotel and will stay here again. It is one of the nicest hotels I have stayed where nothing was too much trouble."
"What a stunning property. The rooms were very well done and the lobby and restaurants were all wonderful. I was impressed most by the service, not from one individual but the overall team. Thank you for a wonderful stay and we will see you again soon."
The St Regis was an incredible experience while in San Fransisco.  It's central to everything and close to a bunch of great restaurants and bars.  China town was only a few blocks away along with a BART station.  So - no need for a rental car.  Museums and great shopping were also abundant.  The hotel staff made the trip even more memorable with their incredible service!
"San Francisco’s Museum of Modern Art brought us to the St. Regis.  When I initially visited the newly reopened MOMA I saw the St. Regis right across the street (Minna) from the Museum and vowed to stay there at some point.  That time came last week and it was a perfect pairing just as I’d thought.  There are installations of contemporary art throughout the hotel and walking thru the building was a true delight.Our check-in process on a Thurs. afternoon could not have been more convenient or more congenial.  I really appreciated the personal attention the staff provided.  Irma at the reception desk was a pleasure to deal with and she took the time to inquire about our plans and was genuinely excited that we were going to spend the next morning at MOMA.  And the following afternoon she remembered our plans and asked us how we had liked the Edvard Munch exhibit.  Irma was everything that a hospitality professional should be: warm, engaged, energetic, helpful and informative.  Throughout our stay at the St. Regis we found that every single staff member we interacted with (reception desk, valet parking, housekeeping, lounge and restaurant) was so welcoming, helpful and professional.  I was usually greeted by name.  This is the reputation that the St. Regis has and we were extremely impressed by our first-hand experience.Our deluxe room on the 16th floor (#1610) had a spacious feeling and the 3 large windows brought in plenty of natural light which added to the airiness.  The dual window shades had motorized controls which were convenient, but I wished that each of the 3 window had a separate control instead of operating in unison.  I enjoyed the combination of glass, textured materials, wood and metal in addition to the neutral color palette which was light and tranquil.  The contemporary/modern art in our room was varied and interesting.  Even the light fixtures had an artsy design.  Our room’s small foyer served as a buffer between the hall and the main room, keeping it quiet.  I never heard any noise from the hallway and all was peaceful during the night.Furnishings included a King bed (very comfortable), 2 bed stands, chaise lounge, large desk with chair, good size dressing table and cushioned bench (which were in a separate alcove next to the bathroom).  There was a wall of cabinets which included the refreshment center (stocked with a nice selection of beverages and snacks), safe, storage drawers and closet—which was adequate for a stay of a night or 2 but would be limiting during a longer stay.  The long, deep ledges below the windows were convenient for placing bags and other items.  Additional amenities: (3) phones, Bose radio with Bluetooth, CD/DVD player, 55” Samsung plasma TV, small LCD TV in bathroom, iron and ironing board, in-room safe, complimentary Wi-Fi (very responsive) and Net connections.  As is the case with many hotels, there was no in-room coffee maker (something I always miss since a trek to the lobby or room service are cumbersome).  Lighting and both quantity and accessibility of power outlets were all good.  The climate control was great and we didn’t have to touch the settings throughout our stay.  When the system came on the sound was very subdued.Our bathroom had 2 sets of fixtures that provided good lighting and there was adequate counter space.  I loved the large orchid flower on our bath counter!  The orchids were also present in the hotel lounge.  Strangely, there were NO hooks or bars to hang towels or clothes.  Actually, the single hook above the tub had a bathrobe on it.  I should have put the robe in the closet but that would still have only yielded a single small hook.  We ended up piling all the towels on the tub ledge.  There was a separate deep tub (looked more roomy than it was) and a large stall with rain shower-head plus a removable hand-held fixture.  Unfortunately, the tub when filled didn’t seal properly and water leaked down the drain fairly quickly.  (I left a note for housekeeping to alert them).  The shower’s water pressure and temperature control were both good.  Altho’ there wasn’t a separate fan, the passive ventilation did a great job of keeping the bath steam-free. The view thru our 3 windows was mostly of a tall, blocky building directly across, but past that on both sides were very attractive buildings representing architecture that spanned the decades.Altho’ the hotel offers a fitness center, lap pool and spa, we had such limited time that we weren’t able to check any of these out.  However, we did visit their lounge and had a fabulous signature spicy Blood Mary and glass of superb Walt Wines Pinot Noir from the Anderson Valley, plus truffle fries and pea soup—all excellent.  The following morning we had breakfast at the hotel’s Grill and were very happy with our truffle frittata, berry smoothie, eggs and sausages.  Service was good too!At 6:00 p.m. a champagne sabering took place in the lobby—the very first time I’d witnessed this traditional, unique method of opening a bottle of champagne/sparkling wine using a sword blade.  It was fun to watch and then to sip the results which was from Mumm Napa, one of my favorite sparkling wines.  After the sabering and sipping we walked the 4 easy blocks up Mission to Roy’s Hawaiian Fusion Restaurant and had an absolutely perfect dinner from start to finish.  Our macadamia encrusted Mahi Mahi and blackened Ahi were incredibly fresh and perfectly prepared.  The service at Roy’s also was exceptional.  The place is popular so be sure to make advance reservations.All the components of our get-away—staying at the St. Regis, having dinner at Roy’s and visiting MOMA—were ideal.  And I couldn’t have felt more at home or more welcomed than I did during our overnight at the St. Regis!"
"A premium branded hotel with 4 star quality of service and follow up. The house keeping removed personal belongings from the table and then to really top it off, our laundry pieces were returned damaged and 5 t shirts missing. The management tried their best and compensated 150 dollars, but that was not the point. How can we trust to leave our belongings in the room or give laundry to be mismanaged and damaged?? As a discerning traveller around the world, St Regis have really need to work hard to live up to their reputation."
"The hotel is consistently superb, a class act.  The lobby bar jams with silicon valley electricity.  Yet high above this energy the rooms provide a calm oasis.  The staff are all genuinely interested in your well-being and make business a pleasure.  Room service and the views of the city make one want to cancel your meetings for the day and luxuriate."
The St Regis is a great trendy hotel near the Moscone Center and in walking distance of everything in downtown San Fran. The rooms are nice and spacious with luxury amenities and the bar is a nice location to meet up with work colleagues after a busy day. This is a great hotel
"I spent one night at the St. Regis for a business meeting.  EVERYTHING about my stay was perfect.  From the gracious greeting at check in, my room, the meeting room, the food and beverage, the fitness center.  All fantastic.  "
This hotel tops all hotels in San Francisco. We had a fantastic time from the start they were so nice and accommodating. Make sure to use the concierge they know the city like the back of their hand and really helped us make the most of our trip. Also ask to have the house car (Bentley) take you to your dinner. Most amazing time we have had in the city. 
"We had a long layover in San Francisco and chose to stay in Union Square.  The St Regis met our needs in terms of a comfortable place to stay, from which to explore some of the touristy areas of SF.  However, traffic getting into the hotel was a nightmare, partly due to Pride weekend when we were there, but in general it did take a long time to battle our way to the entrance every time we took the car out.  Service was great at check-in, but when we asked for a kettle for the room and tea, it took about half an hour to arrive, with no tea bags.  We don't generally enjoy the ""butler"" concept- when we asked for coffee, which was not available in the room like in other hotels, the butler charged us USD18.  There was limited food options- a lobby restaurant/ bar and a second restaurant in the back.  Food was extremely pricey.  The pool was not something my kids wanted to use- a simple lap pool for adults.  We are asked for the kids names and told the housekeeping would deliver ""something"" for them, but it didn't materialize, much to their disappointment.  It is definitely geared toward the business traveler."
"Well situated close to the financial district, a good base from which to walk around the city. Rooms are comfortable and clean and the staff is friendly and helpful. A reliably St Regis experience. Looking forward to returning soon. "
"Having stayed in many places in SF, I found the St Regis to be a breath of fresh air.  The lobby is large and inviting, the check-in process was easy, and the rooms were modern and more than comfortable.  I particularly remember than my bed was amazingly comfortable - even more so than other St Regis properties we have visited.The gym at the hotel is large and really well equipped, and never seems to be crowded. One fun note...I think visiting sports teams stay there as last time I stayed there I did so along with the Cavaliers during the NBA finals!"
"As with any St. Regis, the level of service here is incredible.  I had to stay for a few days for business earlier in the year and with a tight schedule, the hotel and comfort level of sleeping was really important to me.Rooms are very well designed.  Bed is very comfortable.  Staff attends to every and any need that you might have.  I can't say enough good things about their attention to detail and customer service."
"Great hotel for business or personal travel. I have stayed here many times for work. On the last trip, we brought the kids. They had a great babysitting service so that could do date nights. Their pool is a great place for the kids."
This is a beautiful hotel with great large and well designed comfortable rooms.  Rooms are especially nice sized for San Fran.Friendly staff and top notch customer service.We first came here for a birthday and the person checking us in saw the note and gave us a nice birthday greeting.  The hotel also delivered a very nice handwritten card and complimentary birthday dessert to our room that night -- this is the type of small gesture that makes us come back repeatedly for business and personal trips.
"In an area near Moscone Convention center sand multiple Starwood / Marriott properties This st Regis holds its standards, butler optionalMany fine dining options in neighbors. Places to amble or jog or exercise. Safe neighborhood near market street and 3rdNewish facility interiors by Paul Wiseman designCompact property near museums and shopsGrounds across the way suitable for picnics "
This a well positioned hotel for any business trip. It is a block away from Market Street and if you have a coffee meeting there is a Peet's directly across the street adn a Starbucks a few steps up on Market. The bellmen and staff are considerate and eager to help with anything you may need. They also have Bentley house car and butlers if you so desire. There is a business center and gym. If you'd like to stay forever they have residences adjacent to the hotel. There is something on the menu for every one and when the day is done the rooms are very modern and chic. You can relax in a bubble bath and watch the main flat screen as the bathroom opens to your room and a smaller flatscreen to catch up on news while you brush your teeth and groom. I have stayed here 3-5x and never had any poor experiences. If you are deciding vetween thee Four Seasons & St. Regis... Most defiantly choose St. Regis as the Four Seasons needs to be updated and the staff has gone truly downhill. The service has become poor and St. Regis is really stepping it up.
I have stayed here at least 10 times but I thought to write this review because I thought our stay this time was the best yet.  The service was really on point...everyone had their act together.  Its a great location and they are keeping it tip top...I will keep going back.
"The place is decent but I wouldn't call it outstanding. It has a very good location and is quite modern.  The level of service is high, staff is very helpful and efficient and this is truly its best merit. The room was a bit small though with a good view. I liked the design of the lobby bar and the interior - great to see fresh flowers composition. Breakfast was OK too.I liked my stay but something was missing.  Some special approach that you'd expect from a top level 5 star hotel. If you understand what I mean)))"
"The hotel is situated not far from the main shopping area such as union square. There is a 24 hr butler service and the staff goes beyond to make sure you are comfortable. The size of the rooms are standard, most important clean. The bathrooms size is just right. Yes the price is up there, but you really get what you pay for. Also , they have an excellent restaurant at the ground floor called The Grill. Extremely delicious. Will definitely return. "
"My wife and I just returned from a weekend staycation at the St. Regis SF. From the moment we arrived until we left, we felt that the service and people were excellent. I stay in SF frequently for conferences and events and the St. Regis stands above the rest.As an SPG Platinum member we were upgraded to an available Astor Suite, and took advantage of the butler services like shoe shine and clothes pressing. We did order room service several times and it was prompt and enjoyable. I'd like to thank the GM Andre Brose who made special note of my Wife's 30th birthday (which is why we were in the city to celebrate) and made sure that the staff was aware as well as having a sweet treat brought up to the room. It's the little touches that keep me loyal to Starwood and St. Regis.Let's talk about the room - The Astor suite has a fully separate living and bedroom with windows all around, as it's on the corner. It was breathtaking, with views of the city from every window. From the giant Salesforce tower to peek views of the Bay, it was an impressive view day and night!Although they are discreet, I don't have to be... The whole Cavs team was staying in the hotel and we saw Lebron and other players multiple times (staying for their first two losing final games) which made the experience extra fun. We are big Warriors fans but it's always cool to see the players up close and personal.Thank you to the SF St. Regis management, butlers, valet/porters, for making our time in the city our home away from home. They have some advertising saying that the St. Regis SF is the best in the city, and I think they more than lived up to that. We are returning again later this month to see Hamilton and we can't wait to be back at the best address in SF!"
"Well ion advance of our trip out west Mariah at the concierge desk set us up for the best trip possible. She'd helped us some years ago and when I emailed I wasn't sure she'd still be there. Not only did she respond but she also remembered us and was more than helpful and available both in advance of the trip and during. Also Selena and Alexandre (who remembered us from his time at the St Regis NY) were of great help!Also Tatianna and Abhishek with the butler department, Eric at the bar, Irma a the front desk, Freddo at the front door and Linh at the Spa. You will love the place and love the people."
I only write a review when I really feel the need to. This hotel is honestly one of the best I have ever stayed in and we have stayed in some amazing 5 star hotels around the world. The room was so comfortable and staff very attentive. The bar is also one of the best hotel bars you can go to. So spacious and welcoming. I would put this hotel up there with the Mandarin Oriental in Singapore and Grosvenor House Dubai with the best hotels I've stayed in 
"We visited the St. Regis San Francisco over Memorial Day weekend and were pleasantly surprised by just about everything it had to offer. First of all, the location is great: world class shopping is right around the corner, as well as the SF MOMA and it's only a short cab ride (or long walk) to the Haight/Ashbury neighborhood where we had tattoo appointments during our stay.  The lobby is beautiful. It's contemporary yet warm. The lobby bartenders were wonderful and we enjoyed dinner and house cocktails there one evening, it was all delicious! We are both avid weight lifters and used the fitness center every day, it was very clean and had some free weights and several machines so we felt that we weren't slacking on our training while there. The room itself was small but gorgeous. We had an 18th floor corner room that had beautiful views and we even watched a fireworks show one night! We didn't get a chance to use the Bentley house car while we were there but we thought that was a very nice amenity. While in the financial district we walked to dinner twice and enjoyed the proximity of various casual dining options. We also meandered into the W and even the Palace, and were very glad that we had chosen the St. Regis. Staff was all very helpful and the service was exactly what we would expect from a St. Regis. We would definitely stay here again. "
"The location is convenient, just a few minutes walk South of Market & Union Sq.The facilities & rooms are very nice.The staff are excellent, as is the service.The barmen & drinks are also very good.The only reason I didn't award ""Excellent"" is that the food in the restaurant at breakfast & lunch was average.Also beware that certain rooms are subject to a lot of street noise."
Amazing hotel with friendly staff. Location is ideal - walking distance from Union Square. We were given a complimentary upgrade and room was exceptional. We didn't have breakfast or dinner so can't comment on the quality of the food. Only quibble was with the gym - pretty small and stuffy. 
"I just came back from an overnight stay at St Regis.The hotel was wonderful, our room was great and roomy. Very comfortable bed.The service here is amazing!!!!!!I couldn't ask for anything more.We took advantage of the private butler service, to pick up our laundry for overnight dry cleaning.I'm super picky, and I would recommend the St Regis."
"My wife and I stayed at the St Regis for a weekend in April at the end of a California vacation.  This was our fourth visit and we were not disappointed.  This is an excellent hotel in every respect, including the rooms, facilities, food, and most of all the service.  It was warm, courteous, and professional from start to finish.  We especially appreciated the folks at the front desk and the concierge team, which was spot on with every suggestion.  We will look forward to our next visit."
"By far one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at from the cleanliness of the room, amenities, delicious coffee in the morning, and most important of all the service.I have to admit that I've been to many amazing hotels around the world, but my stay at the Saint Regis provided me with one of the best experiences I've ever had.In a world where online rankings can't be fake, This hotel deserves the very best. I would recommend staying there without reservation."
"I tend to travel quite often around the world for business & stayed at various hotels globally & within the United States. The level of outmost respect shown by the staff at the St. Regis San Francisco is of a different level, a level which reminded me of the hotels in my hometown -Dubai- which certainly even exceeded other St. Regis hotels I've seen! Had a situation @ 1 am, needed a USB flash memory, was brought to me from outside in minutes. Also their Butler service have been great committing to each & every request! Room service is angelic so is their Spa & the services it offers! HIGHLY Recommended if you're looking for a luxurious hotel in the middle of the city! "
I've stayed at this hotel a number of times.  Location is central and the rooms are well appointed.  The team always recognizes me and welcomes me back. My only complaint is the prices in the hotel lobby bar.  It's great food and the drinks are well made- just a bit pricy even for SF. 
I have stayed here a couple times for business. I find the location convenient. The service is always very friendly. The rooms are spacious and clean and have nice bathroom facilities. The internet is fast and has always worked. The bar downstairs always has people in it and is very functional without being especially unique. Breakfast is nice but only a la crate is an option. I would prefer a buffet option. The conference facilities work well and the service was good.
"Lovely hotel with cosy rooms and excellent customer service. For the modern art lovers, this hotel is next to the MOMA and walking distance from waterfront. We got the chance to use the complimentary car service (Bentley) to hotel guests for journeys originating from the hotel within 1 to 2 miles radius I believe."
The front desk workers try really hard and are wonderful at welcoming you to the St. Regis. The valet is a bit of a hassle and congested and a wait but the inside staff tries to buffer that hassle with their polite and charming way. The gym and yoga room are especially nice and there is a pool as well. The lobby has a bar and comfortable seating so you see lots of groups meeting and people hanging out working on their computers. It is warm and welcoming. The location by the SFMOMA is a huge plus since this museum is one of the best in the country.
I loved this hotel. Had a premier room on the 18th floor overlooking 3rd Avenue and Yerba Buena gardens. Room was large and well equipped. All staff were friendly and helpful with out being false and over attentive. I have to call out the reception and restaurant staff for particular praise as they couldn't have done more for us. I'll always stay at the St Regis when I'm in San Francisco. 
"My last trip at this property resulted in me writing an unfavorable review regarding the lack of access to basic spa amenities usually included in a luxury hotel (steam room, hot tub).  I had a miserable cold and was hoping 5 minutes in the steam room would help. Although, to my knowledge, access to these amentities are still for purchase only I removed my previous review purely because of the wonderful response I received from the hotel management, who went above and beyond to correct the issue and make up for it.   Upon speaking to the front desk and explaining to them my frustration with charging paid guests extra to simply use these amenities was not congruent with the luxurious and seamless that the St.Regis prides themselves on providing, I received an immediate written apology, some wine and permission to use the steam room for the duration of my stay.  I've re-written my review to a 5 star because that is really what this property is.  Aside from this experience, this place is THE place to stay in San Francisco when it comes to room comfort, excellent food, ideal location and now - customer service. Thank you Andre B and the entire team for making this experience as on par as all the other weeks I stayed with you!"
"staff, particularly Ms. Hsiao, were very friendly and helpful.  Room was excellent; room service was good (some minor issues), but they took care of me extremely well.  I often stay at other 5-Star hotels in SF; this one is as good or better.  Highly recommend!"
"My husband and I were in San Francisco for business and had the luck to book an evening at the St. Regis. We happened to be in a lull day and the gentleman who checked me found a suite upgrade. Now had I known that a suite comes with a 24 hour butler service I probably wouldn't have even tried to ask for a suite but he was so gracious it wasn't at all awkward. The butler service is something you really must experience if you have the chance. I was on East Coast time and was able to arrange for tea and coffee at 5am, they helped me print out some documents for work, they shined our shoes, offered a lovely turn down service and even brought in a table setting for two when we decided to run out for a casual takeout dinner. They could not have been more hospitable or more accommodating.The property itself is incredible. If you love water they indoor infinity pool with a terrific spa (I did a quick round trip of the whirl pool, sauna and steam rooms). Our room was appointed in lovely understated detail. The couch in particular made me wish we had time to lounge and watch a movie! If you want considered, unobtrusive luxury this should be a top choice."
"The Hotel is located in proximity to many local destinations and shopping. Upon arrival, the staff were all very accommodating to our every need and helped us quickly and efficiently check-in. Our room was spacious and had great city views from the 18th floor! We enjoyed using the exercise facility which was well equipped, and enjoyed a relaxing afternoon swimming in the heated indoor infinity pool. We loved the modern and contemporary feel throughout the hotel and its grounds. Overall, the hotel exceeded our expectations and I would recommend this hotel to any San Francisco visitors. "
"Great service,Great rooms ,Great food Excelent! The concierge knows exactly what you need. Te breakfast restaurante it's delicious. The lobby bar it's a very comfortable and enjoyable place to relax, get a drink before dinner. "
"I rate this hotel at over 4 stars but not quite 5. My boys loved this hotel and couldn't stop talking about how fancy it was- I think they were really impressed by the modern decor. This was a great hotel for our weekend stay- the hotel restaurant was good, we were within walking distance of shopping, parks, restaurants, museums, we had a gorgeous view of Yerba Buena gardens. Our rooms had floor-to-ceiling windows which afforded an unbelievable view but affected the noise insulation- we could hear all traffic sounds despite being on a high floor. The drapes, lights, and climate were all accessed via touchpad (bonus!). The pool was fun, clean, and had a nice surrounding area for folks to relax if they weren't swimming. Just a few cons: the beds were super hard. We requested a pillow top but never received it. There was no coffee maker in the room! Whaaaa? We had to call down and request one- they set it up in the hallway between our connecting rooms.Overall, great hotel, we would stay here again. "
Loved staying here! Great location! The rooms are incredible and the restaurants and bar area are a great place to hang out. Rooms are well equipped for working and relaxing. I didn't want to leave the property!!!
excellent staff - I lost my mobile phone in a cab and they helped get it back for me - they were very helpful and although staying longer elsewhere in San Fransisco I would book a stay here next time  - nothing is too much trouble
"As a frequent traveler as well as someone who enjoys nice hotels, I can comfortably say that the only way to describe this hotel is unbelievable. I want to start off by saying how amazing the staff is here truly what sets this hotel apart from any other establishment in San Francisco. I can assure you that the staff makes you feel like they are welcoming you into their home. All extremely eager to help as well as extremely enthusiastic. I'm a traveler with specific needs when I travel. I hate scents. I like to be comfortable as anyone should feel. I was very impressed with the hotel in how all my needs were accommodated. We were given an amazing upgrade which made me feel super welcomed and excited for stay. The overall means on how we were accommodated were shy from out of this world.The rooms are unreal. Very spacious with a modern touch. It's not so modern to where it's cold it honestly is very warm and inviting. The decor sets this hotel apart. A city such as sf is notorious for crammed hotel rooms which are outdated. The newest and the best technology is clearly apparent throughout the facilities making it more efficient than the normal property. I can assure you that my stay was the best stay I have had in SF in the past years. They have a House car which can take you in the evenings to restaurants in the area. It doesn't hurt that it's a Bentley either. In addition the spa looks very nice unfortunately I did not have the time to use it. I did however have the time to check out the pool which is a great escape for a relaxing afternoon in the city. The stay was amazing. Below are some staff members who made my stay extra special in there own unique way:- Hung (FD) made checking quick and was very helpful as well as informative - Veronica (FD supervisor) kindly welcomed us to the property and was a gracious as well as an outstanding host. She continuously looked after us on our more than amazing stay. Brightened up our smiles and made this trip more than me memorable with her beyond positive attitude and more than gracious hospitality - PM doorman was the first image of the hotel and greeted us with a smile also was kind enough to arrange for the Bentley house car to take us to dinner - The overnight crew who was there for us when there was a slight hiccup which was discovered while trying to find an outlet for my phone. - Steven in reservations who was able to help me make sure my stay was going to be more than seamless by assisting me in choosing the best accommodation as well as package. - Maryanne at the concierge who helped plan our Easter Day in the best way possible. During our stay there was a slight hiccup pertaining to something discovered unexpectedly while looking for an outlet for my phone charger. The way in which the situation was handled was seamless and professional at the absolute highest levels possible. The overnight team assured me that it would be rectified first thing in the morning, which it was. The following day, after returning to our room we had a personal note from the hotel manager, Andre Brose, apologizing for the mishap. It's the little things like that which set my whole trip apart. Even though there was something which did occur unexpectedly, the hotel not only rectified it in a professional manner but also made up for the issue. That on its own shows that customer service is valued and delivered at the utmost highest level possible. This stay was nothing shy of 5 star and 5 diamond. You can guarantee that I will be back for every trip I take to San Francisco whether business or leisure. This hotel is worth every penny. "
"I am unsure how different hotels get their ratings. I mean what do have to get to attain a five or six star recognition.  This abode in the Starwood has a 7 point rating so I guess the expectations are high.  Maybe this sometimes is part of the issue in the projection of what to expect.  That accompanied by a rather gorgeous looking website which makes the hotel look extra splendid.  So on entering the hotel I was rather surprised to find that everything was far less spacious and smaller than given the impression.  There is a line fire that greets you and behind that a bar with seating. And that’s it.  To the right is the front desk and concierge and that is your total lobby. It feels boutique rather than grandeur so the first issue is to get your head around that. We were shown to our room which was modern without feeling totally up to date in your face no techno design. It was pleasant.  Before we set out we had numerous emails from an assigned ‘butler’ asking was this a special occasion and was there anything we could do to further embellish our stay.  We did inform them we were celebrating an occasion.  So this was the first disappointment. Our room bode ill in fact that the only adornment was a cactus – I mean if you are into feng shui surely this was an omen.  There were no flowers, chocolates, drink or even a little card from our best friend the ‘butler’ who had appeared so concerned about our welfare.  And having been to Venice in the summer where all of those items were in our room including a cake had been present it was all rather flat.  Plus the fact that there were no amenities left ready in the bathroom we were initially rather disappointed in our inception to the hotel.   We did offer feedback to the hotel and they did try and make amends.  The staff are delightful and despite our setbacks we did get used to this hotel which felt more like home than any grandiose experience.  There are several other drawbacks which without wanting to be too critical I would offer to the traveller.   We enjoyed breakfast in our room.  This is called ‘fine dining’ another word for room service which has the same odd connotation as ‘butler’.  My husband did have on one occasion the most incredible eggs benedict – the hottest and most professional ever served in the room.  On another occasion he had one sesame bagel and I had three pieces of toast with tea and coffee and the bill was $71.  Of course this was absurd as four pieces of bread could not be considered fine dining and certainly we could have brought a shelf of bread at Wholefoods for that.    The bill was duly amended to $50.   I personally believe that these prices belong to a hotel offering better services.  The lounge downstairs, the only room to plonk yourself in between sightseeing is also frequented by outsiders.  So if you come back late there will be a host of business people complete with their computers doing work and it is very often difficult to find a seat.  Please note that if you wish to have a guest over between 10.30am until 12pm there is NO FOOD offered in the lounge!!! This means that you have to order from ‘fine dining’ in your bedroom. Apparently there is no call for an extra waiter to be used at these times. So would I go back to this hotel. Well it  is in a superb position. Next to all the art galleries and a short walk to Union Square.  The vicinity has good restaurants and the hotel offers an evening drop off service with their car.  The most redeeming feature of this boutique hotel is their staff.  They were kind, patient and professional.  With every problem they rose to the occasion and attempted to find a solution, even if it did take away valuable time from your holiday – yes I would return with lesser expectations.  We happened to use Starwood points for this stay – was it worth it – not really."
"When one pays this kind of price, all we want it meets our expectation; and it sure did. Easy check-in, got upgrade to a room with a view with my SPG gold status, fabulous comfortable room that everything worked, used the gym a couple of times, final bill was right and simple check-out. Non-eventful and that's what wanted."
"The hotel is in a great location next door to the SFMOMA. The housekeeping was phenomenal, and the attention to detail was very noticeable. The staff members I encountered were polite and very efficient in executing my requests. The room was bright, modern and very comfortable. The breakfast was superb but very expensive. The bar was very pleasant, and they mix an excellent martini. I would not hesitate to stay at the St. Regis again in the future."
"My two girls friends and I had a trip to SanFran and we're lucky enough to get a special rate at the St. Regis. I travel often and have to say (and not just because of the company) this was one of my favorite and most memorable hotel experiences.The hotel was spotless. The staff are spot-on. The service....you get the point.The ONLY negative comments I have are: the rooms are not sound proof and our neighbors on the last night were very vocal! And the staff were able to see us in the pool area one evening, offered up bringing us plastic wear for our champagne (THANK YOU!) but it was a little creepy.I cannot wait to repeat a trip like this, and hope we're fortunate enough to enjoy this property again."
"This was our first trip to SF. The hotel choice was therefore rather important. Our friend recommended St Regis & put us in touch with the Hotel. The detailed attention paid to our booking was very impressive. They noticed that I was traveling with my son and on their initiative suggested the type of beds & room. They were also prompt in their replies to our queries. During our stay, the level of service was kept at a highly personalised basis - making sure we were comfortable. They even provided a car to drop of us off within a 2 mile radius from the hotel.The rooms were very spacious. About 450 sq feet.  We had a good view of the city from our room.  If there is any criticism on the rooms, it would be a minor one - they do not provide for toothbrush and toothpaste which some other 5 star hotels provide.The hotel is strategic located. Within walking distance to most of the tourist spots like Union Square, MOMA SF, Chinatown, Museums and the Pier One. Overall, the St Regis San Francisco is an excellent hotel with a high level of personal service and strategic location."
This was a lovely hotel and the bed was very comfortable(most important in my hotel stays). We stayed for 2 nights. I'm not familiar with San Francisco but the hotel seemed to be situated in businesspart of town?  Not close to shopping.The lobby was large and there was a busy bar located in the vicinity with a fireplace.There were just 2 small problems- the bathroom toilet ran and there was thumping sound at night (music)? I used my ear plugs.
"We recently spent a weekend at the St. Regis and found the overall hotel, and our room, spectacular.  The staff we welcoming, courteous, and always helpful.  It could be easy to miss the actual entrance because it is not actually facing Third St.  It's important to turn right immediately before reach the St. Regis to get to the entrance."
"We stayed over the weekend for a birthday celebration.  The front desk/staff were alert to that and made a great gesture providing our bday girl with a really nice handwritten note and some chocolates, plus some other kid stuff.  It's typical of how service oriented the St Regis is.  We took advantage of the gym and the pool.  One thing - the gym is for 15 yo and older - our 14 and 12 you were asked to leave - politely by a staff member, but it was definitely a downer to them as they just wanted to use the treadmill, something they use at other gyms (hotel or otherwise).  But I can understand why the St Regis does it.  So we opted for the pool, which is a nice salt-water one.  It's indoors and has a nice seating area that accompanies it.  But it's too short for real laps and visibility in the water is murky b/c of their concoction of salt and chlorine.  Water temp was nice, if on the warm side.  The elevators are fast and you are never waiting for one.  The bar is nice in the lobby and service is attentive.  The rooms are impeccable and spacious.  All in all, this is what St Regis is all about and we'd stay here again if we have the chance."
We completely enjoyed our 3 night stay at the St. Regis. Everyone from the front desk to the restaurant and lounge bar staff to housekeeping were extremely friendly and helpful. Great lobby bar with fireplace and great drink offerings. Don't miss the sabring of the champagne on the weekend evenings! Our room was well appointed and had a great large bathroom ! Highly recommended!
"Came for a quick city break to SF. Chose this hotel because it looked modern, fresh and top shelf. It did not disappoint. The corner room we booked was large and beautifully decorated. Modern, clean, stylish and oozed quality. Bed super comfy. I booked the romance package so we were a bit disappointed that A) the champagne wasn't in our room on arrival and B) it wasn't actually champagne. They did remedy  that quickly however. The breakfasts were fantastic. Really tasty and hit the spot nicely. Location great. Quiet stay as well."
"We stopped in for a post-SFMOMA visit.   First drink was tasty so we were hoping to get a second but after 45 minutes with no service we went to the bar to get our check.  I told the bartender about our experience and our initial intention to have another drink, I got a stale ""I'm sorry"" but no attempt to rectify the situation. After another 20 minutes I received my check.  I expect more from St Regis!"
"Staff is very welcoming, helpful, and professional. Note that rooms on lower floors can be noisy if you're close to the nightclub. Be sure to check out the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art that's next door to the hotel."
We spent the weekend with our family that live in Marin. We had a lovely corner room (904) & an adjoining room (903). The location was great. The teens enjoyed the indoor pool. (but they thought it could have been a little warmer). The food in the grill was very good.  The remote that controlled the shades was cool. Loved the bath products.Overall I would recommend this hotel.
"I think that title says it all - you get *exactly* what you would expect from this hotel. It's high end, clean, well-located, *expensive*, and has great staff. In fact, the standout here is the staff, who were nice and went out of their way to make me feel welcome. Location is fine, near Moscone and an easy (and flat!) walk to Union Square. Rooms are well appointed with good flat screen televisions. No coffee in the room, but free tea/coffee in the lobby every morning. Gym is well-equipped, and I never had a problem getting on the equipment I wanted, no matter what the time. Overall, a very pleasant stay."
"Lovely hotel, with excellent service and quality. Very conveniently located with easy access to Union Square, the financial district, restaurants, bars etc.The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, and went out of their way to make my stay comfortable.Definitely worth every penny spent."
"The hotel design and location are first rate.  Service is excellent.  Rooms have clean, modern design and high tech features.  The hotel is also well located close to the Moscone center and the financial district.Free coffee and tea service is available at the bar in the morning.  The gym offered everything you'd need to keep up with your workouts when on the road.So why am I disappointed?  In two out of two stays in the last 3 years, there's been a mechanical failure that impacted my stay.   Three years ago, it was a power outage.  For that one, I texted a friend at the nearby Palace and went to his room to shower and get ready for work.  This time, it was a water issue.  The water wasn't working at 7 am - prime time for many showers - and I had to wait.  Not long - maybe 15 minutes - but a delay nonetheless.   At ~$800/night, it's too pricey for a system failure.  "

"Surprisingly, San Francisco seems to have many hotel options, but the property's and service offered seem to fall a bit short of other major cities. That said, the St Regis delivers on most areas that count. The check in was easy and Irma was sweet, efficient and friendly. The butler arrived with my bags minutes after check in. The room was spacious enough to work, the amenities were replaced daily and of good quality. The bed was comfortable and the linens cool and crisp. The work out room was clean and not crowded. The misses are tiny, just enough to notice, but not so much as to feel put out, if you are on a corporate rate. As others have noted, if I had been paying the full rate, I would be much more critical. I thought breakfast was exceedingly high and did not deliver what the price would promise. Drink prices here rival Paris and London, but without the ambience or the service. I had no complaints at all however, and enjoyed my 4 nights. The hotel is located in great neighborhood and easily walkable to many sites. Great views and peacefully quiet."
"What a service, yes rooms are a bit small, but quality and completeness is absolutely great. Linen, towels, slippers, etc. all of highest standard. Super Spa with indoor pool. Delicious breakfast. Great valet service, concierge very helpful. No need to say more. Always glad to come back!"
"We start every year with a short stay at this property. Even though we only live a couple of miles away, we love spending some time here to enjoy the facilities. My son especially loves the pool and his welcome package. Easily one of our favorite properties in SF. Room service is very good and accommodating ( sometimes we are able to get some special meals if we made arrangements in advance....was especially helpful when the little one was a baby). Service is impeccable !"
"Located in South of Market close to Union Square, Financial District, Yerba Buena Square, there's shopping, restaurants, cafes, museums, and theater in the surrounding area.  The staff is amazingly friendly and helpful.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable.  I highly recommend this hotel it's convenient and elegant and provides for all your travel needs.  The butler service is very helpful, I can request tea service when needed throughout the day.  The closest BART station is Montgomery Station located 2 blocks away with easy access to SFO.  There is no need for any car rental as most attractions are accessible by food and there are abundant taxis and carshares within minutes.  In San Francisco, parking is a hassle and usually more troublesome so if most of your travel plans are within the area, i would recommend foregoing a car rental."
"I lived in the St Regis residences for a while as a tenant while going through a bitter acrimonious divorce. At the end of this process I returned to the property almost a year after leaving. When I checked in I was greeted as a former resident and welcomed back! The Spa is exceptional, the pool divine for laps or playing with the kids. The bar is the perfect place to meet friends and lovers."
The attention to detail and the smooth atmosphere inside the lobby is worth to experience.  It is within minutes of local transportation and important places in SFO.  The rooms are always clean and the staff is very friendly.
We stayed here for 3 days during following a long drive up from LA! The one big thing that stands out for us was the staff - they are lovely! If you choose anywhere to stay in SF - this has got to be the place!Location is great and we even got a free car service one day in a Bentley around town!
"We stayed two nights and this was our second visit. I prefer the layout of the deluxe king room with the shuttered tub adjacent to the sleeping area. However, I think because my husband is an SPG member, they automatically upgraded to the executive room.  Neither of us liked the room layout. The closet is in the corner of the room near the desk and it is quite small for two or more travelers. The bathroom feels narrow and small with the shower literally opening directly  into the toilet area. Because of the awkward layout, the wall mounted television is completely offset from the bed and is more suited for viewing from the desk. (Not that we watched any TV, but if this is something someone would like to do from the bed, it's not ideal!) Long story short, I'd skip the executive room. Either book a deluxe on a high floor with a view or splurge on the Astor suite if you'd like more space. A butler can bring you coffee in the morning. However, if you are they type of person who cannot stand any human contact until at least three sips of hot brown liquid, you will need to request a coffeemaker for the room. Easily done upon check in and they will deliver a pot and all of the necessities.  Service is excellent at the hotel. Speaking of service, I had left my book face down on the bed to hold my place and when I returned to the room, turndown had placed a bookmark in my book!We tried the spa and enjoyed our treatments. The spa is interesting. There are separate locker rooms. After changing, there's a small co-ed sitting area. Then guests are taken in an elevator to the separate gender waiting areas and treatment rooms. Personally, the waiting areas feel sterile and like a doctor or dentist office!  I prefer a more dimly lit and relaxing environment at the spa. We ate at the Grill and enjoyed our meal. The service was timely and friendly without feeling overbearing or intrusive. Pros: Great service, very responsive staffHousekeeping is greatOn-site restaurant is goodSpa OnsiteGood fitness facilities and lap poolGood location in close walking distance to union square, shopping mall, movies. The ferry building and Chinatown are farther but very doable. "
"This is my 3rd visit and I keep thinking how great my life would be if I lived here. The rooms have the most calming beautiful decor. The staff is incredible from the valet to the porter, front desk, bar tender mangers, security, restaurant servers and housekeeping. My visits have been short and on off hours and everyone I encountered was fully invested in making my stay perfect. This hotel exhibits the gold standard of professionalism and attentive management, in the good sense. No issue or request is too complicated. Even during an SPG points snafu on my 1st visit, the manager reached out and handled it beyond my satisfaction. The food is also great and I recommend the Eggs Benedict and turkey club for room service. Another tip, the kids menu is available late night in case you need chicken fingers, etc. Also, I love the lobby decor. "
We stayed at the St. Regis over Christmas Eve and Christmas holiday. This was a perfect place for our travels.  We were traveling with our small Pug and Yerba Buena park is across the street from the hotel which is convenient for traveling with a dog.  We ate breakfast in the hotel dining room many times and the service and food were very good.  The lobby is sleek and modern and has free coffee in the early morning.  We stayed on the 20th floor and had an expansive view of the city.  The Museum of Modern Art is right next to this hotel.  The guest rooms are sleek and modern and super clean.  Not much closet space for two people but we made it work.
"The St. Regis doesn't disappoint -- great personal service, modern cubist rooms and an efficiency that can't be denied. But the sleek modernism and sharp corners are lacking the charm of a historical perspective that I prefer in pricy 5 star hotels. But once you recognize what it is, it's great. "
"I've stayed at this St. Regis a number of times over the past five years, and frequently visited for cocktails and brunch. It was hands-down one my favourite hotels in the world.So, for our last-minute wedding in San Francisco just before New Years, it was a no-brainer to stay at the St. Regis. I let the staff know the reason for our stay in my reservation. When we checked in, they acknowledged our wedding the next day, and offered us some champagne -- a nice touch.Things headed downhill after that.  In our room, I noted that our room had none of the automatic bedside controls that I'd always liked so much about this hotel. This sounds like a first-world problem, but, when you're paying ~$800/night for a room on New Years weekend, it's reasonable to expect it to meet high expectations.Also, the staff had a chilled bottle of champagne for us with a nice card as well as a plate of celebratory chocolates.  Unfortunately, the chocolates were drizzled with the words ""Happy birthday!"" -- again this was our wedding, not our birthday.  And the card on the champagne was addressed to ""Mr. and Mrs."" even though I'd made it clear in the reservation that the wedding was for me and my partner (two men).  Again, felt like the staff was oblivious to the details -- and that's what really separates exceptional from just-okay hotels.That night, we ordered room service and I ordered the St. Regis's dessert item called ""our interpretation of tiramisu"". The most interesting part of their interpretation was that -- halfway through the dish -- I chomped down on something that wasn't food -- only to discover that they'd dropped one of those silica packets that are used to preserve things into my dessert!  I definitely won't forget that interpretation of tiramisu!With the hotel scene continuously changing and upgrading in San Francisco, I'm probably done with the St. Regis after this stay. :("
"I have been traveling to San Francisco many times over the years and this was my first opportunity to stay at The St. Regis.From the moment I arrived the hotel was fabulous.  I actually arrived early and was just going to put my bag up while I attending meetings but at check in they let me know that they had a room available already and allowed me to check in at 9 am which was fantastic.The entry, lobby and building is very nice.  I really enjoyed the lobby area, the way everything is laid out is very relaxing and welcoming.The room was absolutely perfect.  I had a corner room and everything in the room was clean, comfortable and very classy.  All the amenities that you could possible want are there and the room is an excellent size.  The bed was tremendous, slept very well.  I love how everything in the room is controlled by a panel that is beside your bed.  You can control lighting, drapes, alarm everything directly from the touch screen.The bathroom was very nice, it has a look through into the room but you can close the shutters.  There is a separate soaking tub and rain-shower that is really nice.  A little extra water pressure would be nice but that is a small thing.I had a chance to grab room service, the food selection and time was awesome, about 30 minutes from order.Check out was fast and efficient and truly enjoyed everything about the stay, wish it was for more then 1 night."
"I think that this was our 18th stay at the St. Regis, at Mission & 3rd Streets, in San Francisco’s SoMa (South of Market) Area. It seems that we are here about 3x per year, alternating between the St Regis and the Palace (both SPG Luxury Hotels, and part of AMEX Fine Hotels & Resorts), also in SoMa. Each stay has been excellent, and this cool, rainy January visit was no exception. Unfortunately, we were only staying for one night, instead of our usual 2 - 3 nights.We had a late arrival, which was good, since our flight from Phoenix was delayed by two hours. Everything was ready for us, and we were greeted by the doorman by name (a really nice touch!), and welcomed back. The same with the reservationist – though we had not stayed there in six months. As we were dining early that evening, we were glad that our room was ready, but we had so little to unpack, that we were back down into the lobby for a glass of wine, in front of the lovely fireplace, at the back of the bar area.Each of the bartenders welcomed us by name, and we even picked up a previous conversation on fine-dining in San Francisco, sharing new recommendations with each other, as though we were there the night before.We travel extensively, and often stay at favorite properties in various cities, but very seldom encounter the level of welcome (and recognition) that we do at the San Francisco St. Regis. I am not quite sure how they do it, as it is not just the doorman, the desk agent, but everyone, who magically recalled our names, and greeted us as returning guests. They are near the best that we have ever encountered at this.Now, our room, 1006, was a smaller Deluxe King, but very comfortable. There is a small “swooning couch,” a desk, the King bed and a bench at the foot of it, and then a separate bathroom w/ tub, walk-in shower and separate WC. The wall, between the bathroom and bedroom has a very large opening, which can be closed off for privacy, or quiet, in case one of us is taking a shower, while the other one sleeps. When open, this “window” gives the impression of a much larger room.The closet had a safe (horizontal, and not vertical, as too many hotels have gone with – where one has to stand up their laptop, tablet, or almost anything), an iron, an ironing board, and a valet with hooks to hang clothing, while packing (nice convenience), cloths brush, shoe horn, laundry bag, shoe-shining bag (complementary), and also a shopping bag! The latter might sound odd, but in San Francisco, there is a shopping bag surcharge, so it is great that the St. Regis provides one – of course, it has their name on it, but for someone, such as myself, that does add a bit of needed “class,” when I am walking on Market St.The room has several nice automation features, such as the area lighting, electric shades (both privacy and blackout), a “Do Not Disturb” and a “Please Make Up My Room” button. The latter is very nice, as one can signal Housekeeping, when they will be away from the room.There are AC outlets scattered around, and a multi-port charging station on one of the nightstands. We had a music system/clock, and there is also a DVD player to go with the large, flat-screen TV. The bathroom has a smaller TV, with limited channel selection, but nice to catch local news and weather, while getting ready for the day – in this case, cool, and rainy all the time.Very comfortable, and with so many nice features, including a full line of Remède Spa amenities in the bathroom. By the way, the Remède Spa is located on the 5th and 6th floors in the St Regis, and is lovely.In all, a perfect stay, and unfortunately, for one night only, this trip."
"Stayed for two nights over Christmas 2016 and was very pleased. The room was large and well appointed, the view was fantastic, and service was spot on. The best part of our stay were the little things like the hotel giving us a gift on Christmas Day and the fresh baked cookies always available at the front desk. The only nit I have is that $54/night for parking is borderline outrageous. That said I'd happily stay again. "
St Regis at San Francisco was a perfect location within a short walk to Union Square and shopping and food destinations. Hotel is extremely well kept and deserving of the 5 stars. Food Quality was excellent as were the rooms. Staff were also welcoming and helpful and certainly professional.We will stay there again!
"Easily the best St. Regis I have stayed in.  All service was quick and on-point.  Concierge and bell staff is excellent.  The linens and bathroom amenities are very nice. I have stayed at the Four Seasons two blocks from here, and surprisingly the two hotels are a toss up.  Both are 9 out of 10."
"I loved this hotel, the location and property were very well kept up.  The staff AT the hotel were also amazing.  For some reason I had issues before I arrived where I never got a response from the ebutler or reservations teams.  I kind of hate that these properties advertise things like that and then they don't work.  Mostly because I wouldn't expect a property to have one, but don't have it if its not going to work perfect.This is another hotel where I'd request a non-connecting room.  I was staying for work and could hear people quite well.  The connecting door is in the hallway and the sound from the stone floor makes everything eco between rooms a bit."
Visited the city for one day on a weeks vacation in Napa....it was a real treat.. suite was spacious and well  amenitised ... bed comfortable with plenty of towels... quite  with great room service Very centrally located
"Excellent property.   Beautiful room, spacious, clean, very nice.  Bathroom had really nice shower and tub.   Pool is nice although too small for lap swimming workout.  Gym is useful.  Great location in middle of Soma."
"The modern decor is very well done. The open lobby and bar area feature some fabulous art. The staff is excellent.  If there is a line at registration, the concierge pops over to assist, and visa versa. The  rooms leave no stone unturned. Plenty of lighting, which you can adjust to your liking. Electric window treatments, including black out shades. We did not dine here, but we did have a very enjoyable drink at the lobby bar. It is literally next door to SFMOMA, and an easy walk to BART (Montgomery station), and the cable car.We used spy points (30,000), so I cannot comment on value. They gave us a late checkout, even thought we were non revenue guests."
"Stayed there over Christmas and specially chose it because we thought we would be guaranteed a wonderful stay at st Regis, given the brand name. We were wrong, so wrong.  Save for the front desk, every other system failed. Management should really review this.  The first day is Christmas Day, we came back to a room unserviced.  When we called, we were asked if we left the do not disturb sign on, as though we were idiots. We said no, we put on the make up room sign. The concierge was as good as the internet booking service. They had nothing to suggest for Christmas night save to tell us countless times it was Christmas. Yes we know hence we called for your help. Guess they are not the four Seasons or the Ritz even though they try to pitch themselves at that level. The final clincher was the last night room service or what is pitched as ""private dining"".  We were promised half an hour, 40mins later, the food hadn't arrived. When I called, they put me on hold for a minute of pure confusion, to tell me that it would take another 15 mins. Clearly the order was forgotten.  Instead of sending up starters or bread first, they were silent for 20 mins. I had to call and ask again. They said on the way.  5 minutes. 10 minutes passed and I had to call and it was on the way. It's not so much the initial error that infuriated, it was the constant lying and empty apologies that aggravated the situation.  It was our last night in sf and we thought staying in for a private dining experience would be a sweet ending. It was not to be. Give yourself a proper holiday and stay somewhere else. "
"I just returned from the 3rd of 3 stays at the St. Regis San Francisco over November and December 2016. I am combining all 3 stays for this one review, which I believe gives full perspective on why this hotel is the class of San Francisco. For me, the St. Regis San Francisco is not only the best hotel in San Francisco but also my favorite city hotel in the USA.My first stay was Nov 9-11, 2016, for work (alone), where I was upgraded on a paid superior king room to an Astor Suite.My second stay was Nov 29-30, 2016, for work (alone), where I was upgraded on a paid superior king room to a Metropolitan Suite.My third stay was Dec 15-18, 2016, for leisure (with my husband), where I had been provided a complimentary Astor Suite as service recovery from a poor stay in Dec 2015...but I was upgraded again to a Metropolitan Suite.I also mention that I am a SPG Platinum 100 nights/Ambassador level guest. I have always been upgraded to at least an Astor Suite at this hotel, almost entirely based on complimentary Platinum upgrades. Check InFor all dates, check in was easy and simple. For the first 2 stays, I actually had applied my SPG Plat75 benefit of Your24, allowing me to have confirmed an earlier 2:00 pm check in time. I was offered a butler to show me to my suite both times, but I only took advantage of that on my first stay. For our 3rd stay, we had a 5+ hour weather delay and didn't arrive until almost 8:30 pm. I had called the hotel concierge earlier to push back our Quince dinner reservation that evening from 8 to 9 pm, which they did with ease. On arrival, the GM and butler escorted us to our room--though they begged off showing us some room highlights since we had to quickly make our 9 pm dinner reservation!RoomIronically, I've only ever stayed in either an Astor Suite or Metropolitan Suite at this hotel. I find the Astor Suite more than sufficient for 1 or 2 persons, though the Metropolitan Suite is perfect for 2 persons. ASTOR SUITE (1st stay)For my first stay, I had the Astor Suite.There is a nice living room with a L couch sitting area and table looking onto the TV and cabinet, as well as a separate desk area. There are huge windows allowing lots of natural light and a view onto the downtown area of the city. There were automated controls to lower the blackout shades for darkness and/or privacy. There also were manual curtains for softer privacy allowing some light to pass.The bath is a little on the narrow side, but was more than enough for 1 person. It would be a little tighter for 2 persons, perhaps. There is a double vanity, nice bathtub, and niche area with the toilet and shower stall.The bedroom was nicely appointed, with lots of windows again and tons of natural light. There again were automated controls to lower the blackout and softer shades for darkness and/or privacy. My one complaint with the bedroom was that the blackout shades were not entirely blackout; one or two of them were more translucent, allowing light to bleed a bit in the morning. For me, that's a no-no; for others, that may not be an issue at all.The closet space was more than adequate for 1 person on a shorter stay. It may be more of an issue for 2 persons or for a longer stay.METROPOLITAN SUITE (2nd and 3rd stays)I had the larger Metropolitan Suite for my 2nd and 3rd stays, just as I'd had on most of my previous stays, to be honest. The suite bedoom and bedroom both are larger. The living room is much more spacious with open plan living/dining areas, separated by the desk and including a true dining table. While the Astor Suite seems to face north, the Metropolitan Suites I've had always face west, giving a nice view of the city and hills (and occasionally of the fog rolling in over those hills).There is more of an entry hallway for this suite type. The main living room again has a true dining table, the desk separating the dining and living areas, and the same couch/seating as with the Astor Suite. There are automated controls to lower the blackout shades for darkness and/or privacy, and manual curtains to offer softer privacy with more light.The bedroom is larger but has only 1 side with windows--but still offering plenty of natural light. There again are automated controls to lower the blackout and softer shades for darkness and/or privacy.My one issue in this Metropolitan Suite (room 1708) was that the blackout shades that dropped were not both completely solid/blackout; one was more translucent, such that light still bled through in the morning. This was similar to what I had experienced in the previous Astor Suite. That would be completely remedied for my 3rd stay, however--see service--when they added a 3rd set of blackout curtains to provide complete blackout conditions (room 1908).The view from the suite was wonderful, looking out to the west hills and Moscone center.The TV cabinet in front of the living room seating area also had a hidden mini-bar.The bathroom in this suite is also much more spacious, easily accommodating 2 persons without issue. The same amenities as in the Astor Suite bathroom, just laid out with more space. ServiceService was outstanding for all 3 stays. For our 3rd stay, however, service was completely flawless. Overall, I'd have to say that my experience for all 3 stays was as close to Aman-like as I've had without staying at an Aman hotel. Only Singita Boulders and the Gritti Palace recently have approached this same level of service.There were a few miscues on my 1st and 2nd stays with butler service not answering the phone due to some issues with the phone system; that clearly had been worked out for our 3rd stay. The wifi wasn't working so well in the Grill for breakfast on the first morning of my 3rd stay.Otherwise, though, service was exemplary--friendly, enthusiastic, and always genuine. From valets who knew my name, to reception agents who always knew my name, to the housekeepers, concierge, bar and restaurant and other staff, service truly was as if I had returned home.I had rental cars for my first 2 stays. Getting my car from the valets was always seamless--no more than 10 minutes after I called from the room, my car was always ready. Unlike other reviews, I had no negative valet issues at all on either of my 2 stays.Service for our 3rd stay was truly remarkable. The hotel manager, Mr. Brose, walked us up to our suite. To make up for the issues from 2015, and the butler phone issues for the 1st and 2nd stay in 2016, the hotel offered us both complimentary spa services of our choosing--a very, very nice touch. (My husband took both, since I despise spas. He had a great massage one day, and a wonderful mani/pedi the next day.)The complimentary hotel Bentley car service was lovely for us to get to Quince and Campton Place on our first 2 evenings for dinner. A very nice service, indeed.The hotel originally had scheduled us for wonderful tea service on arrival, but our huge flight delay precluded that. So the hotel provided that to us on our last late afternoon. The hotel also made sure each stay to have the air con set to my preferred temperature of 65 F. While afternoon sun may preclude that in the Metropolitan Suite living rooms, the bedrooms never failed to reach 65 F. I was in heaven.When we got to Quince on our first evening of our 3rd stay, after a massive weather-related delay, the sommelier gave us champagne--courtesy of our St. Regis concierge team hoping we night settle in after such a crazy arrival. It was a sublime touch.On our last evening of that same 3rd stay, we stopped by the St. Regis bar for a nightcap. The very entertaining bartender made us 2 Sazeracs...but ended up missing an ingredient and was extremely apologetic. Not less than a few minutes later we had 2 perfect and delicious Sazeracs...which he would not let us pay for. Even whe we insisted, he refused and said they were on him. Considering this bartender likely had no idea who we were or that we had been set up as VIP guests for the weekend, this just went to the service level that we've always enjoyed and found so impressive at this hotel.Finally, and most impressively, the blackout issue was completely resolved for our 3rd stay. The hotel actually installed a new 3rd set of blackout curtains in the Metropolitan Suite bedroom (room 1908) so that there could be no issue whatsoever. The bedroom was completely blacked out, such that we both slept in quite a bit later than we ordinarliy would otherwise. It was BLISS. Only Aman hotels have ever gone to such lengths to make sure we were so comfortable! We were blown away.From start to finish, the St. Regis team was amazing. Butler serviceThe St Regis butler service seems to confuse or confound some, but I love it. The full range of butler services is available to those in suites (starting at junior suites at most StR, I believe, and at Astor Suites here at the StR SF since there are no junior suites). I always take advantage of unpacking and packing butler services, and that was true for all 3 stays here, as well. Even with me having only packed a carry-on, I still enjoy it. Not only does the butler unpack, but he or she also lays out everything neatly in drawers and hangs everything as appropriate in the closet. For packing, the butler packs everything with tissue paper so beautifully in the suitcase without you having to worry at all. (My husband doesn't trust a butler to pack or unpack, so he does it himself. Fool!)Butler service also presses garments and shines shoes. I've used this sparingly, but I did use those services for my first 2 stays for work. The butler was even able to press and shoe shine in just a few hours on my first stay, which was quite impressive and very helpful.Butler service also brings complimentary coffee or tea every day, whenever you might want it. We take advantage of this service at every StR. I used it for my first 2 stays for work, and we used it for our 3rd stay for leisure. Service was always quite prompt, and it was always very friendly.The butlers also offer an email service whereby you can email for any request. I didn't use this on any of our stays, but it's been most useful at other StR resort type properties.While some are confused by these butler services, I love them. It's nice to have the central butler station to handle all my requests and direct requests to appropriate departments as needed.DiningFor my 1st and 2nd stays, I exclusively had room service for breakfast, lunch, and dinner/snacks. I love room service, as you can tell. Room service at this hotel is wonderful: delicious, hot, and always promptly delivered.For our 3rd stay, we dined our 1st and 3rd mornings in the new Grill restaurant (previous location of the Michelin Ame restaurant). We very much preferred this location to the old Vetrine restaurant space on the 4th (?) floor. Food and service were fantastic. The only issue I had was that the first morning, the wifi signal didn't seem to work well!For our 3rd stay 2nd morning, we had room service breakfast. It was, as usual, fantastic.Basically, food/beverage is a major highlight at this hotel. LocationI love the SoMa location. I find it extremely easy to walk into Union Square or the Wharf, and easy to drive in and out of the city. For our 3rd stay, it was perfectly convenient as we had an afternoon at the adjacent SFMOMA, had lunch at adjacent In Situ in SFMOMA, had dinner around the corner at Mourad, and had dinners at nearby Quince and Campton Place (both less than 2 mi). ConciergeThe concierge has always been fantastic at this hotel. While I have had a few moments where there seemed to be some email confusion, the hotel concierge team here always has come through for me. I rely on the concierge for all restaurant reservations, museum tickets, and the like--and I use the concierge more than most and for more difficult to get reservations than most. For our 3rd stay, the concierge team secured us reservations at Quince, In Situ, Campton Place, Omakase, and Mourad. (In previous years, the concierge team has secured us reservations at Saison, Benu, Coi, Atelier Crenn, etc.)The concierge team was extremely helpful and communicative via email for all my arrangements. I couldn't ask for more.St. Regis BarOne of my favorite elements of this hotel, as with most St. Regis hotels, is the bar. It's beautiful and inviting, right adjacent to and open to the lobby entries and reception, making it quite a focal point for the hotel entrance.I've always managed to find seating in the bar, even when crowded, and I've always had great service. Drinks are great, and the atmosphere for me can't be beat in San Francisco. SpaI don't use spa services. But my husband loves them. For the first time, courtesy of the hotel's complimentary 2 spa service gifts, my husband had a massage and also a manicure/pedicure. He said both were great. He said the spa is nice for a city hotel, though on the smaller side, but with very nice treatment rooms, a spacious pool to make it feel larger, etc. I still haven't even been in th spa here!OverallOverall, the St. Regis San Francisco remains my absolute favorite hotel in San Francisco, in California, and in the USA as a whole. Its service is exemplary, its suites are wonderful, its amenities and location are sublime, and it always goes out of its way to make sure I always gets the best possible service. The hotel really pulled out all the stops for our most recent stay--probably the best hotel stay we've ever had in the USA. Kudos and thanks again, StR SF!"
"Concierge was very helpful. We stayed here on a trip and needed to arrange a car, restaurants and flowers. They did all of this and provided great suggestions. Nice gym and pool too. The location is close to shopping and easy to get to from the airport "
"I stayed for a one night business trip and had a great experience.  The rooms are very well appointed and large.  The bar staff was helpful and responsive, as was the restaurant staff for breakfast, and the concierge was very responsive.  The location is also good - about a 10 minute walk to Union Square."
"I know it seems I always say the same thing about this hotel, but it is hard to say something different than spectacular. This time I had my partner with me since it was my birthday, and guess what, the staff knew about it and made the celebration even better. On the date, I was welcomed in the room with a small cake, a bottle of champagne and I nice card. This is what makes you come back. You would not be disappointed in staying there. "
"All good - Bar was very well run and the staff was great.  Only complaint is we spent too much time there and ran up the bill.  Not the hotels fault but more a comment on how well run the bar is !Room was nice - clean, comfortable and largeStaff were helpful - Always professional and always there when you needed them and there when you did not.No real complaints and I would recommend it to any business traveller!"
This is a good place to stay when in San Francisco. The rooms are nice and well furnished. The service is very good. They have a good bar in the lobby. The hotel is conveniently located. Definitely recommended.
"Understated elegance, the perfect retreat after a hectic day in SF.Pierre, the front office manager, was particularly welcoming, warm and friendly. He offered advice on his hometown in France when we travel there next summer; truly ""above and beyond""! Bravo!"
"room had no closet space, bad use of space , alcoves behind bed added to badly designed room, half of lamps did not work in room, leading to a dark space, shouted at by room service when we enquired why coffee order was taking over 35 minutes at 6am on a Monday. Bar downstairs a free for all on Friday evening, no hostess to be seen, weak drinks, haphazard service. From 3rd you have to walk thru bar to get into lobby, not well thought of interior, cold and not too friendly. Just came back from Rome , stayed at St. Regis there, and have been staying at St. Regis NYC for over 40 years, this does not measure up by half... For the prices you are charging you should be ashamed of yourself for insulting the St. Regis name and reputation. You cannot just put a name on hotel and hope for the best, people are not that easily mislead and you can do a much better job for the brand and your customer base.  "
The BEST hotel in San Francisco. The service and decor are unparalleled.  The food is exquisite and the location is great. I've stayed at many hotels in the city and this is superior. Right next to the Museum.
Nice stay- right next to the museum- close to shops- great service and attention- was really well looked after. This is a really classy hotel and the room is very high tech. I highly recommend this place if you can afford the steep price.
"Hubby and I stayed here for 2 nights over the summer. This hotel is a total gem. Elegant, large rooms, fabulous decor. The staff are lovely and very helpful when it comes to suggestion local nightlife. Highly recommend!"
"The hotel was nice and luxuriously decorated. The location is really good, right in the heart of the city, walking distance to good restaurants and shops. I was rather surprise by the small room and the lack of perks that most five star hotels have. Not even a chocolate or a complimentary bottle of water? It is all very nice, but they will milk your every penny. Also, long waits for the valet parking, we waited over 15 minutes to get the car on a regular basis."
"Hubby and I stayed here for a conference in October and absolutely loved it.  As a preface - we had previously stayed at the Ritz Carlton and it just didn't quite do it for us.  The St. Regis is an awesome alternative.First of all, the hotel location was amazing.  We were able to easily walk most places.We booked an Astor Suite and were upgraded to the next level of suite (metropolitan) and it was beautiful and huge.  It had a dining area, a huge couch and then an entirely separate bedroom and bath (shower and separate tub).  The room was on a corner and had walls of windows with great views of the city.  The room was very nicely decorated and really comfortable.We had room service breakfast one morning and it was very good.I can't really put my finger on it but there was just something about the St. Regis that we preferred to the Ritz.  We would definitely stay again."
Stayed at the St Regis on business. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable. My stay was on the 14th floor. The view was wonderful and city noise at night was never an issue. The staff throughout the property are helpful and accommodating. 
"Amazing hotel in the heart of the city. Walking distance to most attractions. Very elegant, rooms are large, classy decor. Staff is very friendly. Personalized butler service. Complimentary car service in a Bentley! Can't wait for dinner tonight at their restaurant."
"What a spectacular experience for your daughters wedding weekend!!Excellent service. Beautiful views. All of our needs were taken care of before we even asked. This is a first class environment. We used almost every service. Food, flowers, drivers and all of them receive 5 stars. Ate at the bar and drank there too. A+ at all. Highly recommend this hotel. "
"I come to San Francisco on business twice a week and have literally stayed at almost every hotel in the city. Until now, the Loews has been my go-to. No more!My trip at the St. Regis was exceptional. From the polite and professional valets, to the knowledgeable check-in desk, my stay has been perfect.An extra special nod to hotel manager Andre Brose. He is exactly what a hotel looks for in its top management. I reached out to him before arrival with some special requests and ALL were met. Not only met, but exceeded: my room had a beautiful plate of fruit, sparkling and still water and a great bottle of wine. I also had a handwritten note, which was the little extra touch you want at a 5 star property. I even had the pleasure of meeting Andre at check-in. The St. Regis is lucky to have him.My Room was luxurious  without being pretentious. My view was incredible. Fresh flowers, top notch toiletries and great customer service rounded out a perfect stay.I am picky traveler, and when I'm happy, that is testament to the hotel. I will be back on business Sunday and have already cancelled my reservation at the Loews and booked the St. Regis. I suggest anyone wanting a top notch stay to do the same."
"This hotel has great location, excellent lobby, great staff, excellent breakfast, but as SPG platinum member  you don't enjoy the full experience of St. Regis for the following:1- They'll upgrade you to a corner room which is even smaller that many of the regular 5 star hotel rooms in SF. It is not big and furniture is little outdated. 2- They'll ask you to pay for packing and unpacking. I'm serious. The guy told me I've to pay $50 per piece and I told him I'm Platinum and his reply but not in a suite.3- To get your call from valet parking, you got to wait around 20 mins. Once I went over half an hour. It is a mess there and no body is fixing it as it is subcontracted.I've been to many St Regis around the world, this is the only one that I say it is truly not a St Regis. Writing this massage in St Regis Dubai  "
Travelled and stayed at the best properties and have come to realize that it's the people staff who make the property even more amazing than the property itself. St Regis SFO is one of them from check in to the door man. From housekeeping to turndown staff including room service everybody knows why you are here and what will make your stay a memorable stay. I am impressed and believe me I am not easy to impress but these people know what they are doing. Let me give you an example -: I was traveling with my 11 year old and who was unwell but the room service provided me with a full breakfast at 4:30Am cause they knew my son had not eaten the night before . The concierge made it their problem to see if they could get him court-side seats for the game the Bentley was available for our dinner reservations I can go on and on but in short totally impressed even  to the fact that turn down service at night made sure I had kettle to boil water for my son.Hats off to management they have earned my loyalty. You can't go wrong with staff like this.Cheers and kudos to you .
"I only stayed one night but you cannot beat the location. Positioned near Union Square, 5 or 6 storey Macy's store and less than one block to get on or off the cable cars. Beautiful property, great staff and all the amenities. "
"We spent 2 nights in room 1809 in early November 2016.  The room was spacious and comfortable.  The bathroom was well thought out with great lighting and plenty of room.  A great rain shower, oversized plush towels and bathrobes were wonderful.  It was our 35th wedding anniversary and were treated with a tray of chocolates in our room.  Being an SPG Gold member got us a room upgrade and a free drink at the bar. We were able to stay here on Starwood points from SPG/AMEX.  All we paid for was our bar bill.The hotel is about 3 blocks from BART, making an it easy trip to and from the airport.  (Get off at the Montgomery station) If you are attending anything at the Moscone Center, it is right across the street.  The MOMA is next door, between the St. Regis and the W.The hotel provides butler service and has Bentley car service available"
I really enjoyed the St. Regis.  The location is wonderful.  You can walk all around San Francisco.  The Health Club is really nice.  I also loved all the cool features in the room-especially the automatic blinds.
"While there's nothing to dislike about this hotel, I was left feeling like there was also nothing to love. We were in a suite and, as a result, we had butler service (which was nice). The bed was comfortable, the room furnishings were modern. We rode to our dinner reservation in the hotel Bentley. I think that was the highlight of this stay."
"I was so excited to try the St Regis SFO.  I absolutely adore the NYC St Regis but I must say I was very let down by the experience.  I am a Starwood Gold member but at this property that doesn't get you very far.  Lobby was nice and bar is great - but the entire hotel is SO BUSY and feels impersonal.  Not sure if all the guests in the bar are patrons of the hotel or not but there was nowhere to sit on a Wednesday evening at 7 pm until well after 10.  Mayne they should have a private bar for hotel guests only.  I don't love the location either - tons of homeless people all over the streets outside made me feel uncomfortable walking around (but this is a City problem not a problem of the hotel).  We had no early check in, there were several things in the room broken (lamps, vanity mirror, etc).  I reported this to the staff but think at this rate and caliber that should all be checked by staff prior to occupancy.  They also missed an evening turndown.  Of course it is a beautiful hotel but I don't love the modern vibe and somewhat impersonal feel....I'll take the NYC St Regis anytime over this one.  Save the $$ and book the Palace or the Ritz.  So much better as far as I am concerned while staying in SFO."
"The kids are old enough now to enjoy city exploring and so we spent a couple of nights here doing the tourist thing.  Zero complaints with the hotel - standard St. Regis quality.  The only drawback, and reason for the 4-star, is the small indoor pool area.  This isn't something most guest would care about but worth mentioning if you are traveling with kids that like to swim.  Otherwise 5-stars all the way around."
"It is a 5 star hotel with kind and helpful staff. Everything works. You can draw the curtains electrically from Your bed. The lobby was small and not like an elegant 5 star hotel. The lobby bar was nice but small. The room was very clean and elegant in a minimalistic way. I am a gold member of SPG and was told a got an upgrade with a good view. I got the premier executive room which I payed for and nothing else. I say the roof of MOMA and a construction site. The room had more windows than a standard room and was very light. I wanted to have a coffee machine in the room which I got after 10 minutes. After 2 days it was gone. I had to call room service for a new one. The cups which came with the machine were not changed daily.There is butler service in the hotel but only if You have a suite. We were told that it was not room service but the butler who was responsible for the coffee machine which was a bit odd as we did not have a butler as we stayed in a room and not a suite.I booked a car to pick us up at the airport. This was 182 USD, tax and gratuity included. I also had booked breakfast. This cost around 60 USD/dag and meant a 75 USD credit. Some days we did not consume for 75 USD but could not use the rest for another day when we consumed for more, which easily happened as the prices were very high. Coffee was 8 USD. The food was elegant and good although service a bit slow. Sometimes there were more staff than guests there. One guy asked for room number, another said welcome and showed us the table and a third guy took the order. Sometimes we were asked 3 times if we wanted coffee or tea and still it took some time before we got the coffee. The restaurant upstairs was closed, but You could have dinner at the Grill. Wi-Fi was free.I think You should best enjoy this hotel if You have an unlimited budget, stay at a suite with Your own butler, do not make coffee Yourself but order everything from the butler and probably pay a tip whenever You use this service. In summary: a very good hotel, but not worth the high price."
I have been disappointed before by some of the other big names.  Still looks brand new.  This hotel was beautiful in the modern way and despite having been around for a decade you would be forgiven for thinking the place was brand new.  Service from the valet to the front desk to the room was second to none.  I can’t imagine anyone not enjoying their stay there.
"From the moment we stepped onto the property, every possible expectation was exceeded. Sparkling wine and pâtés de fruits upon arrival. A warm welcome at check-in. A calming atmosphere in our room. A concierge with genuinely wonderful recommendations. A butler's handwritten birthday greeting accompanied by chocolates and champagne. This is no ordinary hotel, this is a St. Regis. We have stayed at many hotel brands and styles. If I could choose just one to return to time and time again, this would be it. Worth every penny. Visit the spa. Have breakfast in the Grill restaurant. You can't go wrong. "
"I come to SFO about 5 times a year for work. I've stayed at a number of hotels in the union sq and Palo Alto areas. This hotel is fabulous!  For driving purposes, this hotel is more accessible than four seasons on market st. For walking it's just a block further from all of the major shops. The property is the modern alternative to many of its high-end peers which all seem to be Classic in style. For a city with tons of hotel rooms, many are full of furniture with lots of visible wear and tear.  However, our Astor suite was pretty pristine.   We enjoyed the complimentary benefits of the room - pressed laundry, daily coffee, etc. the gym was sufficient. The linens, towls, and all finishes in the room were high-end. I loved the electronic black-out shades.  I wish the lobby bar was larger so that one could host business drinks there without it being so close to other tables. My only real complaint was our first impression. The 4 bellmen/ doormen were far too busy chatting together at our arrival to open cab doors, retrieve luggage, or even open the door to the hotel.  This tended to be a theme during our visit. There seemed to be a bit of (incorrect) profiling going on there.  Now that the museum expansion is done next door, I'm sure this place will be even more busy. I'll be back very soon."
"Very well located, really efficient Staff, good for american standards, average for European standard, regular for Asiatics standards. Rooms with Park View are much nicer than others. Still expensive for what none US resident can expect about a five star hotel."
"I've stayed here three times! All of which have been splendid and memorable! The staff make you feel like your coming home! There are a lot of choices when it comes to hotels in San Francisco, make it easy on yourself and pick the St. Regis! "
"The St Regis is a high-class hotel. We stayed there for four nights on our trip to California. The reception at the hotel - from the doorman and the reception staff was friendly and very attentive. Our room was very good and mostly well-appointed. There was free wi-fi (if you wanted high-speed internet there was a charge, but we found the free service quite sufficient). The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was well-appointed. The big downer was the fact that - whilst there was free tea/coffee in the bar from 6:30am to 10:00am - there was no facility in the room to make tea or coffee at other times."
"The hotel is pretty much what I expected rom a St Regis.  Pool is just about long enough to do laps in, and being salt water, it was lovely.  Room had everything I needed, and then some, but room walls seemed to be thin as I could not sleep due to (normal) noise from another room."
"We visited for four nights having requested well in advance a high floor which is a must in this hotel and did get it albeit with a very poor view. Also requested a corner room which we did not get. The room was big and pretty nothing spectacular the bathroom was great!The concierge is the best feature of this hotel but you need to be very specific as to what you need. They did get us into a fantastic Michelin starred Japanese restaurant, got us opera tickets, a rental car delivered to our door and several other reservations. Mostly they had a great attitude and disposition to help. Their lobby drinks and snacks are really good but it is not a cozy place. The location is fantastic. Spg still has it!"
The perfect hotel for a trip to San Francisco. Excellent location. Beautiful and modern/high tech rooms. Friendly and helpful staff. Top notch customer service. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to travel to downtown area. Loved how close it was to financial and shopping district too. 
"Watching a football game in the bar after a day of sightseeing. Ordered a beer.  Nice way to relax before dinner. Bartender asks if I really wanted to watch the game. He said he'd prefer to watch the debate. The last thing I wanted to see was that presidential debate when I'm trying to relax. I said as much. His response was ""you can watch for one more minute and then I'm turning the game off.""  He proceeded to follow through. I left. Last time I stay here. "
"Loved the room, the location and nearby dining / entertainment options. On the downside, I paid USD 55 for an a la carte breakfast (toasted ciabatta / latte / orange juice). Find that simply outrageous... I appreciate that in this 5 star segment prices are at a certain level, but for breakfast this is simply unacceptable. Just opposite there's a great Italian deli where you can get very somit for a third of the price at very good quality."
"We stayed 6 nights at St Regis SFO right in the middle of the 'Oracle OpenWorld' which is a huge fair drawing 100k people in the city. We did not know this at the time of reservation though we could have guessed considering the high prices of rooms/suites.We stayed in an 'executive premier guestroom'. It was way nicer than the pictures on St Regis website. The semi open bathroom grants a nice sense of space, with plenty of light, large closets and everything you can expect (except a Nespresso machine which would have been convenient). Even for a rather long stay this category was the right choice for us. Housekeeping was absolutely perfect, and laundry service excellent.The gym is large and well equipped, the swimming pool is a gem, we met almost no other guest while enjoying a few laps. You can even order room service by the pool. The Spa is nice and I had one of the best massage ever by a great male therapist (and we are spa fans so we experienced quite a few all over the world!).Still a few bad points:- the breakfast was slightly disappointing, with repetitive choice. The Benedict eggs were surprisingly bland. Staff was fantastic but the food shall definitely be improved.- the lobby bar is so noisy that we did not even try to have a drink there.- the business centre consists of 2 computers right in front of the elevators at 3rd floor, offering no privacy at all, and colour print is nearly $2 a pageUber cars are everywhere in SFO. Transfer from airport to hotel booked through the concierge was $115 and transfer from hotel to airport with Uber black was $85.We enjoyed several dinners booked by the concierge:- Acquerello for fantastic Italian cuisine in a very elegant dining room- Slanted Door for Asian fusion in a busy and modern restaurant- Alexander's steakhouse where we spent a fabulous eveningOverall we had a great stay!"
"The service was amazing, the only issue I had was that the concierge lost my clothing and did not do anything about this. Everything else was perfect. I would stay here again if they were to help me with my lost items."
"We stayed there for two nights and felt very special.  The staff were all helpful The rooms are very comfortable and the bathrooms have soaking tubs and showers.  This is why we chose this hotel.  We will be going back.  If you like to feel pampered and special, this is the place for you."
"Great location, central to the businesses, restaurants and shopping!The bathrooms in the rooms come with soaker tubs! My wife loves to read a book and soak in the tub, so this is a treat.The automation in the room is great, from closing the blinds & shutting off the light. You get spoiled!"
"We stayed here for 3 nights in Sept and felt truly welcomed and valued by all of the staff that we encountered. Nothing was too much trouble. Our room was lovely, the spa treatments were out of this world. Breakfast was fantastic with excellent service. There is a lot of choice when it comes to deciding where to stay in SF - the location of the hotel was great and the staff really set this hotel apart from the rest - well done everyone! A special mention to Caroline Jewell in Concierge - great service with a smile"
"I stayed at the Hilton but wanted to take out my friend to a great place to have a nice Saturday morning breakfast, reading below reviews I chose the grill at the St Regis. But we had an absolutely bad experience. The restaurant was not too busy, however it took more than 5 minutes until someone came to the table just to let us know that he will get a server to take an order??? really? we waited another 5 minutes. Order was taken and food was served fairly quick. While the taste was good the presentation was bland. White egg dishes on a white plate and no garnish - wow. Not quite what you expect when paying $40 per person...It took another while to get the check... I asked if I could talk to a manager, but never saw one or had the chance to share my disappointment. So I decided to take the time, sign up on trip advisor and share my experience this way."
"What a fantastic hotel! The property is gorgeous, the staff is incredibly helpful and professional, and the location can't be beat. We were upgraded from our executive room to a metropolitan suite which was amazing. The suite was lovely and for being in a busy downtown area we heard very little street noise. The bathroom could've been a little bigger -- only a single sink and the shower was on the small side. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was delicious. We also had drinks in the hotel bar which we enjoyed, however, be warned that it can get quite loud and is not a place to have a quiet drink or conversation. Overall, an excellent experience. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others."
"We arrived rather tired and pretty jet lagged and the property was impressive. We stayed the rest of the afternoon in, enjoyed the beautiful views from the suite they upgraded us to and had gorgeous room service, although rather expensive.In the morning we had breakfast downstairs (if I would have known it was not included in the price of the room I would have ordered at the room) which was a bit slow and not as good as dinner. All in all it was a great experience but it was really, really, really pricey. I guess San Francisco is also not a cheap city but I found it a bit too expensive."
"We stopped in for breakfast before our cruise.Very nice hotel and restaurant, great service, food was great!The reason for four stars... My cream pitcher had mold in it.They replaced it and apologized and also removed the charge from our bill. I was not too concerned as mold is not life threatening lol."
"Our stay at the St Regis was delightful.  The lobby is charming and very nice for drinks.  The design is suitably modern and chic.  I did not have a chance to eat at their restaurant, but the spa was fantastic - probably the highlight of the hotel.Parking is easy with valets always on duty.One negative I would note is the proximity to Market street and the numerous vagrants and mentally ill in the area.  Certainly makes one feel unsafe and I would not recommend walking around the area of the hotel at night."
"I always enjoy the St Regis.  Service is great, location is ideal and the people are attentive.  Lobby bar service is good but I wish they had a larger menu.  The food they have a great, just would like more options  "
"Amazing service, beautiful room, great location, delicious food. The only thing I didn't was satisfied with, it's that we were on a couples trip and they gave to all a double bed bedroom and there was no way to change it to one bed"
"This is a great hotel, conveniently located across the street from SFO MoMA. If your trip to SFO includes one or more visits to MoMA, consider this hotel. The room was clean and quiet. I would have rated this hotel as Excellent had I not been shown to a seat at the back of the empty restaurant for breakfast on my last morning there. It was an offensive move by the hostess but I got over it because I had otherwise had a great stay."
"My husband and I celebrated our 26th Wedding Anniversary at the St. Regis in San Francisco and we had an incredible time.  The front desk staff was friendly and welcoming. They greeted us with champagne and a warm anniversary greeting. Marianne at the concierge was very helpful in making a restaurant reservation at Prospect. The room was beautiful, modern and very comfortable. We had a beautiful view of the Moscone Center and the park. There was champagne and a delicious chocolate cake and sweets for our anniversary when we entered our room. We absolutely will stay at the St Regis again! It is our new favorite hotel in San Francisco! "
"What can I say? Everything is perfect here as one might expect. We were welcomed with a great Platinum member upgrade to a corner room. The room was as amazing as I had hoped. The drinks and food in the lobby lounge were delicious. The infinity pool is not to be missed. We had it all to ourselves and it was such a treat! Finally, we enjoyed private dining for breakfast as special treat to accommodate our difficult itinerary. I look forward to returning the next time in San Francisco. "
"The St. Regis surely now ranks among San Francisco’s top luxury hotels. Its location is perfect for both visitors attending events at the convention complex and for tourists exploring the city’s great sights. Located just a bit south of Market Street, in now fashionable and high-energy SoMa, the St. Regis is across the street from the new Museum of Modern Art, a 10-minute walk from Union Square and a 12-minute walk from the Embarcadero and the Ferry Building. Within a few blocks are a bunch of restaurants and coffee shops.The St. Regis is very much a new, modern hotel. It does not boast the majestic and historic settings and interiors of the legendary Nob Hill hostelries nor of the iconic Palace Hotel nor the Asian elegance of the Mandarin Oriental. Instead, the St. Regis offers crisp, clean lines in its public spaces and rooms. The bar, off of the lobby, is extremely inviting, and buzzes onward from late afternoon. The guest rooms are spacious with large, modern baths, while the suites are magnificent in their layouts, furnishings and decor. As expected, the hotel’s staff hits the right tone – extreme competence and efficiency coupled with friendliness and even charm. The breakfast (from a menu, not from a buffet) was excellent, served in a wonderful and elegant dining room; the same venue offers a very good lunch, where the low noise-level makes it possible to chat comfortably with one’s tablemates. The main restaurant, where dinner is served, seemed (in July) to have been in transition between its former self and an emerging incarnation. In its place, clearly temporary, is what one staffer described as a “pop-up restaurant.” I assume that ultimately the St. Regis will have a full service restaurant worthy of the hotel’s reputation.For those looking for a genuine 5-star San Francisco hotel experience, the St. Regis should be on any short list.  My recent visit was my first to the hotel (previously I’ve favored Nob Hill); I now know that on my next San Francisco trip, I’ll return to the St. Regis."
"From the moment we arrived everyone was very pleasant and helpful ...professional as usual! The rooms are lovely but could use a little more closet space . I would not give high marks for the food. Our lunch was good, however our room service dinner was mediocre at best. I will sa,y  that we had a delicious cheese tray at the bar during happy hour. Our server, Lauren was the best!  All in all, a lovely stay! We will definitely be back!"
"Unfortunately, this hotel is not as good as many would like you to believe here on Tripadvisor. And in a world of honesty, customer feedback, and openness it's important to understand why a hotel such as the St. Regis fails to hit the mark in so many places.First, this was a 5-day trip in their Metropolitan suite which is a solid $1,200+ per night rate. So right off the bat, if you're paying these prices you expect nothing short of excellence.The St. Regis is a designed to be a money making machine. If you want a view, even though you're staying in one of their best suites, you need to pay more. They have ""high"" and ""low"" level suites of the same floorplan, the former of which are designed to take more money from you. Even a request to the front desk doesn't change anything. You want any sort of view? Pay more.The hotel is well appointed, the staff is receptive and attentive (a little too attentive actually), and the rooms are clean but nothing exceptional. Again, don't lose track of the $1,200 per night suite rate here. The room service staff are very well trained and exceptional. But here's where things start to collapse.As mentioned previously, the GM of this hotel cares about one thing only: money and how to squeeze guests as much as possible. Don't get me wrong - I love to splurge and stay at some of the finest hotels in the world. The St. Regis is NOT one of them in light of their service or lack thereof.As a regular guest of the Four Seasons in SF, Los Angeles, Hong Kong and China I thought the St. Regis would be a nice change of scenery. But it wasn't. It was an average appointed suite with simply impersonal and obvious service.When you have a guest spending $5k+ during their stay, or even a guest spending $500 per night for a regular room - treat them better. Welcome them with some water and fruit - it's the bare minimum you can do. But that doesn't happen here. Even if you have a special note in your reservation. They don't care.What they do care about is fake smiles and impersonal service, and also charging you a $5 ""delivery fee"" for room service in addition to including a 21% delivery charges (only 75% of which goes to your server). What happened here was the GM sat in a room with hotel operations and asked the question of ""how do we extract every penny possible from our guests and confuse the crap out of them."" Above is how.When staying at the Four Seasons or the epic Upper House in Hong Kong, they know who you are (even if it is your first time!), they welcome you with fruit, refreshments, even gifts. At the Upper House in Hong Kong, I was greeted with $500 of welcome gifts. Do I need it? No. Does it make you want to go back? Absolutely.The hotel itself has no outside areas, no patios, nothing. A patio overlooks the Yerba Bueno gardens but this is reserved for Residence guests only. No matter what kind of suite you're staying in, you're not going there.The bar is subpar, drink service takes forever and their selection is very poor. They have two red wines and two white wines. Pathetic.The St. Regis doesn't make you want to ever return. Because they're clawing for your cash but can't provide personalized service that warrants it. They can't provide a 5-star experience, simply a facade on which to rest on (their brand). But this won't last forever. They'll get you the first time, but they won't get you again. Because there are FAR better places to stay in San Francisco or the world in general. The St. Regis just blows. And I'll have an even more in-depth write up on my blog shortly. Because the world needs to know why they shouldn't stay here.What a disappointment, what a poor experience and what a money hungry hotel that doesn't get what it is to run a real hotel: a hotel that might charge quite a bit, but a hotel that will keep you coming back time and time again.Don't stay here, go elsewhere. You won't regret it."
The hotel is up to chain's standards yet it isn't over the top which you come to appreciate for some of the St. Regis properties. The hotel and its facilities are well kept. Service could be better. Prices from the in room so in room dining menu were outrageous though. Besides this it was a great stay. Highly recommended. 
"From check in to check out , staff at the reception desk was superb. I did carry my own carry on , bellman did offer assistance. Room was very clean and elegant. Over all service and top notch. Staff very pleasant, Guys are at the door was fantastic."
"We stayed for 4 nights at the St Regis and we had a great experience overall. The hotel is  very well located, walking distance to Union Square, China Town and the Embarcadero area. We got a beautiful and modern room, overlooking the Buena Vista side, the bathroom was great, bed was good. The down side would probably be the common areas of the hotel, starting with a sort of awkward breakfast, sort of narrow room, out of the main building area, not the most appealing, kind of a weird location, you don't really feel in a St Regis. Lobby is very dead, not much action or glamour in the Bar. Overall a great stay and professional service. I would probably stay again because of conveniently located and room kind."
"We were there to celebrate my birthday, room medium size, bed really comfortable, big tv, excellent view, bathroom big enough, the only thing B- was running water in toilet, no too much pressure. Walking distance to union square, Chinatown , little Italy. A lot of uber cars, always available in a short time. There are a lot of upscale stores around union square . "
"I do always very much enjoy staying at this property.  We had a very wonderful stay in the Astor suite.  Breakfast in the Grill is much more pleasant than it used to be in the past in the dining room upstairs.  Service attentive and professional, only annoying habit remains that the bar is being emptied/cleaned up whilst still in operation for the last hour of service leading to it feeling unpleasant and not very relaxing.  Check out this time a total nightmare, very long lines as people were checking in, after just over 15 minutes I gave up as I needed to go to the airport- very poor.  It's not comparable with the standards of the St Regis NYC but it's overall a very nice property with mainly excellent service."
I stayed there for business purpose and had nice experience. The hotel is close to proximity and about 10 minutes from Union Square. The attendees were over warming but you have to go out to have Indian food. Overall I would recommend this place and prefer to stay on my next visit.  
"We stayed at the St. Regis for three days with my 4 month old and 2 1/2 year old for my birthday in Sam Francisco. The room and hotel are amazing!!!! The staff was so friendly and professional, the room service was great and breakfast at their resturaunt was delicious ! The gave my kiddos a welcome gift of two jellycat dolls , a coloring book and a teething ring, along with balloons and candy in the room. It was such a thoughtful surprise after traveling all day with these two! The location was good, walking distance to Yerba Buena gardens and the museums which was perfect our first day. The service was amazing and it's no wonder the St Regis has the reputation of quality like it does! "
"A first class hotel.I don't have much to say about this hotel, everything is full on 5*. If you are looking for a 5* hotel in the financial district of San Francisco, look no further.It is probably more of a business hotel than a tourist hotel. However, my family and I stayed here at the end of an 18 day road trip and found it very comfortable and a good base to explore San Francisco.We did have a problem when we were checking in, the information we had been supplied by a 3rd party web site was not accurate and the room we had booked, did not exist. The hotel sorted this out quickly and professionally."
I believe this place has been open for the past 10 years. I recently stayed here again and it was still beautiful with great service. The staffs are always helpful and friendly. It's rather small so get very personalized service which is great.
"We stay in San Francisco about 18 times per year. Most often, we stay at the Palace Hotel in SoMa, but when we do not, we stay at, and greatly enjoy the St. Regis, also in the SoMa Area.The property is different from the Palace, in that it is more modern, has a bit of a minimalistic design (almost Asian), but is also great, luxurious and oh so friendly. The staff has always been excellent, and this stay was a perfect example of that. We were due to stay one night, but meetings kept getting changed, and changed, and the reservation staff kept working with us, every step of the way. Finally, it appeared that we would need to accept a lower level of room, though we are SPG Gold (bordering on Platinum), or change rooms, during our stay. Well, the staff pulled some strings, got us a nice, and significant upgrade (for the entire stay - in the same room), plus treated us to wine in the bar, as our room was not quite ready. They also were able to accommodate us, with late check out, though they were near capacity. As always, the staff was great, welcoming, and so very accommodating.Our room was lovely, and though not as large as the Corner Suite, that we had the week before (1803), was very nice, spacious, and comfortable.The King bed, while a tad crowded in the bedroom, was comfortable. The rest of our suite was very good, as well.We have always found the St. Regis to be very quiet, and our room, on this stay, was no exception. One almost wants to whisper, at the St. Regis, as noise just seems totally out of place.During this stay, we availed ourselves of the Bentley to dinner (within a 2 mile radius, and first come - first served). That was lovely, but then it took us quite a bit, to hail a cab to return. I might suggest the ability to book ""both ways?""Though it is in flux, and transition, dining on-property was quite good."
"I had some special needs with the concierge and Mr Michael Belluomini, chef concierge was very helpful.The hotel besides the good location and confy rooms, has a very good staff to help the guests.Its an island of ellegance in a city crowded of homeless people"
"From the moment I checked in, the personalized attention was perfect throughout my stay.  Not overbearing.   The room was immaculate, modern, and bathroom was unique.  The concierge staff was simply amazing!!"
Stayed here after the last visit in 2010. Property and rooms were still exceptionally and beautifully maintained. Location close to top shopping and restaurants. Design that is pleasing to the eye and very courteous and well trained staff left us completely satisfied.  Dine in meals served within 25 mins. Food tasted  excellent and was non-greasy. Bar staff was also friendly and helpful. Don't miss a chance to enjoy the drinks menu at the lobby bar. 
"Recently stayed at the St. Regis San Francisco.  To start I haves stayed at other St. Regis properties all over the world, from NY to Singapore they have all been phenomenal.  The San Fran hotel is beautiful however the service is where the major issues are.  From receiving inaccurate information about the hotel restaurants upon checking in to the bell hop never coming when called to get our bags when checking out the service leaves something to be desired.  We waited at our breakfast table for 15 minutes before anyone even came to our table.  Even then it was not even the waitress who started taking our order.  Once she realized someone else was taking our order she came over and made us repeat our order to her.  She never came back to the table after that and no one filled our water or coffee.The champagne saber is something we look forward to when staying at a St. Regis.  Here the champagne toast was a joke, they only had a bottle to pour and there were at least 10 people standing around for a glass. Usually there is enough to drink for everyone in the bar area.These are just a few examples but overall not the service you would expect at this kind of hotel."
"Great location, service, food, lounge and room. Second time here in the past couple of years and it never disappoints. I like the location because you can walk to shops, movies, restaurants and some local attractions. We have a corner room which had great views of the city. I highly the St. Regis, San Francisco."
"My new husband and I stayed for 3 nights at this hotel having travelled on our honeymoon from the UK to Vegas, then Hawaii and then San Francisco as our last stop before returning back to the UK.This is a lovely hotel and if you want somewhere posh to stay then this is the hotel to you. It's extremely clean, modern and the staff are professional, welcoming and friendly.The only grumble I'd have is that our room was by the lift and you could hear the bell of the lift when it arrived and each morning someone would be calling the lift at 5am which woke me. That's it though. It wouldn't stop me from booking again though, I'd just ask for a room away from the lift.We had a lovely stay here and a memorable time in San Francisco."
"    When we tried to book a hotel first I looked at The Palace but it was sold out so then we booked this hotel (St.Regis) and we made the right choice, because the service was phenomenal and the hotel was so so beautiful. The breakfast was excellent. The location of the hotel was exactly in the center of the city, so we could just walk about anywhere."
"We spent two nights at the St. Regis. We were greeted very politely. I also was valued and recognized as an SPG Platinum member. The hotel is one of the nicest i've had the pleasure to stay at in the United States. The whole experience was truly luxurious! The only negative thing I could think of is the SPA/Pool area which could use a renovation (stainy/rusty showers etc.). Also there were a lot of unaccompanied kids being very noisy, but this is of course not the hotels fault. All in all this was a great experience! "
"A truly sensational hotel. Nothing was too much trouble during our stay and there was absolutely nothing to fault, whether this was room-related or service-related. A special mention for a delicious breakfast selection - the best way to start the day and gather strength for a long day ahead. We will definitely stay there again when we next visit San Francisco."
"I have stayed at the W next to the St Regis here many a time- and finally had a good enough rate at this property to try it out this year.  I had an amazing stay at the St Regis, my room was wonderful, and of course the location is perfect.  If you can find a reasonable rate, I certainly recommend this property!  The service at this brand is impeccable, as is the food and drinks that they offer.  My butler was amazing as well!!"
"Me and my family really enjoyed staying at this hotel. However the hotel was of more business type. The hotel was located far from most of touristic area such as union Square, pier 39, etc. It was located in financial/business district of SF.The room were clean and comfortable."
"This was our first time visiting the hotel, and we loved it.  The staff was beyond helpful.  We arrived quite early for our reservation, expecting to have to stow our bags and come back in a few hours.  Instead they immediately found us a gorgeous room and had our bags there in minutes.  They were extremely helpful with restaurant recommendations and reservations.  The room was huge with a lovely view.  I will definitely go back."
"We have enjoyed staying at Starwood Resorts almost every time we travel.  This hotel did not disappoint.  Upon arrival, we were greeted with bottled water and gourmet chocolates, allowed to check into our room early and were pleasantly surprised at the size and amenities in the room.  The butler service was exceptional, spa was greatly overpriced but nice, bar area was perfect with a fire feature running all the time and nice variety of food/drinks, and taking the Bentley to dinner was also a nice treat---albeit a short one!  The concierge was also extremely helpful in assisting with dinner one night when we changed our plans last minute.  Don't miss the champagne ritual at 6pm---fascinating fun! If you are looking for a contemporary but elegant hotel with excellent service, I would highly recommend this place!"
"This never happens...get to a hotel at 11am for what should be a 3-4pm check in and they gladly provide us a beautiful room, w/incredible view right away. The decor is chic, elegant, and the staff is very high touch. Everyone is looking to serve. Perfect location, well stocked mini bar and QUIET rooms with exceptional bedding. We'll be back."
"Wonderful hotel in a great location.  Customer service really outdid expectations.  Is very difficult to offer good service without being smothering but this hotel did that.  My mother got sick back home and we had to cut trip short.  Staff was super friendly and understanding.  Usually dread calling front desk as any request becomes a pain.  Kudos to the group here for having it together!Room was great, room service excellent."
"The rooms are wonderful and quiet. The staff is excellent. The fitness center was clean and had treadmills, etc. It' like an oasis in the midst of the hustle and bustle of San Fran.I would definitely stay here again."
"I have stayed in other St. Regis, in Mexico and in Doha. They are always very high quality and extremely new and renovated with the best in room technology. That is why I booked it in San Francisco as well. And it did not disappoint me. But addtionally I found an extremely kind people all around, specially at breakfast. Highly recommended. I only miss and outdoor swimming pool, though I undrestand that not very useful in SF, it would have been when I was there"
"I couldn't have been more impressed by my recent stay at the St. Regis. It's a gorgeous, modern hotel in a perfect location. The service was excellent, absolutely top-notch from the doorman to the reception and concierge. The maid service was THE BEST I have had at a hotel in a long time. They folded everything I left on the floor (I can get a little sloppy when I travel :)) and they even wrapped up all my iPhone and computer plugs nicely. These are the little things that it feel like have become a thing of the past even at the usual 5-star brands. Anyways, I was blown away by the kindness, the cleanliness, the gorgeous room, and all the free water I could drink!! Helps that it's next to the newly re-opened SFMOMA and an easy walk to Union Square. Like I said, location is perfect, and the hotel is an absolute winner. Easy to see why this is #1 in SF."
"Outstanding location adjacent to SFMOMA and Moscone Convention Center.Comfortable beds.Courteous,friendly, and very helpful staff.Indoor pool and great spa.Lobby lounge and bar are tops.Excellent breakfast,lunch and dinner in the Grill."
"Traveling with my family, it was important for us to find a safe and convenient location.  The St. Regis fit that bill.  It was within walking distance to shopping on Market, the cable car on Powell, and museums.  All staff were friendly and accommodating, but there were some staff we found exceptional.  We especially liked working with Kathleen (concierge) and Hersol (sp?, waiter).  Hersol was always right on with service by starting breakfast with juice and a delicious banana bread and speeding up service when we were in a rush to hit a tour.  An indoor lap pool was high on our priority in selecting a hotel.  In this case, the pool was heated, clean, and rarely used.  Many times, we had the pool to ourselves or with one other small family.  This made swimming laps easy and comfortable.  My daughter liked it so much that she often asked to end touring and to return to the pool to swim laps!I didn't give the hotel 5 stars because our room had fairly thin walls.  One night, we heard our next door neighbor loudly talking on the phone and very clearly singing (off-key unfortunately) with intermittent shouting, ""Can you hear me?!""  (Oh yes we could...until midnight when security finally came by to ask her to presumably be a little more quiet). The 5-star rating was also withheld because although the hotel had a car service, it was only available at night and for drop offs (not for pick ups).  I much preferred Fairmont Pacific Rim's car service in Vancouver, which drives guests for both drop offs and pick ups in a small vicinity in Vancouver."
"I booked a suite for a night at the St. Regis.  Upon arriving, my room was not ready for another couple of hours, so I chose to upgrade to another suite.  When entering, there was visible dust/debris on the floor, table by teh entryway, window seats and desk.  I was very taken aback as this was ~$1500/night.  I called the staff, who came upstairs to inspect and sent me to another suite, this time with the same problems.  Grease stains on the wall, water marks on the surfaces, and stains on the carpets.  Very disappointing."
"We were beat after a visit to the new SF MOMA and needed some tender care.  We received it here in a very pleasant lounge.  Comfy upholstered seats, impeccable service, lovely popcorn munchies, great cocktails.  Very much needed pick-me-up.  Yes, you pay more than you would at a beer pub, but it's all about what you are looking for.  In this case, it was comfort, and we got it."
"We enjoyed the evening champagne ritual. The bar was very happening. The rooms were a bit disappointing. Lacking in technology features but mostly just small and without remarkable fixtures and finishes. Obviously in downtown, rooms are going to be smaller on older buildings such as this. Still we felt the value wasn't there. We've since found better options."
"I'm a frequent business traveler, typically staying at Hilton properties, but this hotel is a stand out example of doing things the right way from start to finish. The desk staff is courteous and attentive. The decor throughout from the lobby to the room is top notch and the bed is very comfortable. The desk chair is about the only thing that isn't comfortable in the room, but that's almost nit-picking. Maid service is above and beyond what you'll normally experience and room service food is delicious and served quickly. Start to finish, this is an outstanding lodging experience."
"From the time we had our car doors opened, to the time we left and they closed our car doors, everything was spot on.  The service and kindness from every person there, the food, the drinks, the room, the amenities, all just really took our stay in San Francisco to another level and having such a close and enjoyable walk to AT&T Park made this the perfect stay for us."
"We stayed at this hotel whilst visiting from the UK.  The staff were all attentive, friendly and extremely helpful.  The rooms were spacious and modern and extremely clean.   The hotel as you would expect is pretty pricey but worth the money.  We used both the fitness centre and spa and were equally impressed with both.  Our bath plug was broken and as way of apology we were given a bottle of red wine and a full cheeseboard.  Massively impressed and would stay here again when visiting"
"Our family (2 kids ages 10&13) enjoyed a wonderful week at the St Regis. From the moment we checked in, the service and the facilities were amazing. Friendly bellman, excellent recommendations from concierge for restaurants and getting us sold out tickets to Alcatraz, lovely housekeepers (thorough and thoughtful), an excellent restaurant with complimentary coffee and croissants every morning. The pool was clean and heated salt water and was never crowded. Perfect location to walk to most things and easily commute to waterfront. We can't wait to return! "
The St Regis is a lovely hotel and  I frequent it in various locations - this one is set in the heart of pretty much everything. The Museum of Modern art is literally outside the front entrance. The service is amazing and the staff are delightful and take pride in what they do.The Gym and Spa are both incredible!!!!!!
"Stayed for two nights in April. Room was okay; a little small for USA but I live in Asia not so bad for me. My room had nice view. Gym was good. Internet is free and fast. So far so good, right? Well.......Breakfast was only so-so in terms of taste and service was pretty slow. But the real shocker was my experience in the lobby bar at 9:00pm on a Friday night. A group of 6 young women entered the bar,  split up into pairs and started trying to flirt with and approach all of the guys in the bar. I was with my father who is 80 years old so we were left alone but the two guys seated next to us got approached three times in fifteen minutes; one very loud pair of girls was very persistent asking for room numbers and wanting to go upstairs ""to get high and get wild. After the two men talked to one girl for 2-3 minutes and rejected her suggestion to go upstairs together, she got angry and said they still had to pay her US $50 ""for taking up her time""! About an hour later a different group of girls came in and did the same thing. I noted the bartenders seem to know the girls so I guess this is a regular occurrence (?). Worst of all when I got back to my room that night there was an envelope under my door addressed to me by first and last name containing 6 ""free""drink tickets and complimentary entrance tickets for a nearby strip club.  The envelope and paper were official St Regis stationery. Clearly someone who was working in the bar or hotel is giving out stationery, room numbers and guest names to girls and sleazy places nearby. I was pretty shocked. When checking out the next morning I raised the issue with front desk staff. They looked embarrassed but said ""the bar is a public place"" and then wouldn't make eye contact. Pretty lousy performance by a brand a thought represented true class!"
"I've stayed at all of the 5 star hotels in San Fransisco, and St Regis, is by far the nicest one I've been to yet. Rooms are very clean and comfortable, and had all the modern accents that I really like. For me, quality of room service is a big make or break, and St Regis did not disappoint. The spa was great and my massage was one of the best I've had in a long time. Obviously if I have to point out a con on the hotel, I'd prefer it to be a little less expensive, but in San Fran, nothing seems to be inexpensive. Overall it truly is a 5 star property and will be going back to this hotel from now on for my stay in the city by the bay."
we were a group of 10 and had a great time. they upgraded one of the rooms to a suite which became the highlight of our holiday as we then could have breakfast all together in our suite. the room service was also excellent and they took special care as we are vegetarians. their conceirge was also very helpful in making us plan our day and our other meals. would love to go back there again.The only thing that i was not comfortable with was that they dont have changing rooms near the swimming pool and they have some in the spa which they dont all the house guests also to use and one time they were not open only.
"I stayed in this hotel during a business trip to the city. The hotel is really nice, comfy and very modern interior with a location that is close to many managers based in the city. We traveled to many of the meetings in the city by foot.We had dinner in ""Grill"" Resturant and the food was really good too.Would really recommend it for business travel.For families and holidays, a more relaxing set-up and a hotel a bit closer to Union Square might be better suited (not that this hotel won't do)."
"My company hosted an executive breakfast at the St. Regis, and it was somewhat of a letdown. The venue was outside under a big tent overlooking Union Square, and since the event began early in the morning, the temperature was too cool for comfort.  The two portable electric heaters installed by the hotel were woefully inadequate.  Also, since we were basically ‘outside’, the street noise was more than apparent.  At one point, 7:30 AM to be precise, the introduction of our panel speakers was rudely interrupted by clanging church bells.  Maybe the church was doing maintenance.  Maybe a famous diplomat was having his baby baptized.  I don’t know.  But I do know that the bell rang about 19 times.The food provided by the hotel wasn’t stellar either, appearing far more continental than gourmet.  There were croissants, cut fruit, dry cereal, and the St. Regis equivalent of an Egg McMuffin.  At the price we paid, approximately $70 per head totaling almost as much as my bathroom renovation, I would have expected champagne, smoked salmon, eggs cooked to order, and Eggs Benedict.Rooms in the hotel might well be memorable, but based on how little we received for the money we spent on our event, I am suspicious about St. Regis’ price/performance ratio across the board."
Great hotel! Service was 5 star! Concierge was top notch. Loved the spa and saltwater pool. The bar service was excellent had a nice bar menu and specialty cocktails.  Hotel was immaculate the evening service was great even came twice due to our schedule. Would highly recommend for pleasure or business. 
"This overdue review is the final capstone of having stayed at well-reviewed hotels in every class of service in San Francisco.  After years of local staycations and business overnights, this hotel ranks #1 on my list.  Interestingly, I do not think I would necessarily rank it number one in any particular category.  There are hotels with much better views (Lowes), better service (Four Seasons) and more esoteric categories, like best bathtub (Hotel Vitale Panoramic Suite). I rank it number one for the following reasons:1. Not a bad room in the house.  Even the normal rooms incorporate beautiful design and great tubs.  Frankly, unless you need the extra room, there is no particular benefit to booking a suite.  2. Excellent service.  I understand that YMMV, but I have always received impeccable, if not unctuous, service.  3. Great location.  Right across from Yerba Buena, next door to the MOMA, etc., etc.,etc4. 24 hr room service. More to the point - delicious food served at the appropriate temperature from room service.  This is usually a weak spot for even good hotelsCons:1. This is not a ""best value"" hotel - it is a luxury hotel and priced to match2. They used to have an amazing ""destination"" restaurant in the hotel - Ame - that was truly wonderful.  That has not been replaced with anything nearly comparable.  These are not significant drawbacks - there are numerous amazing places to eat within walking or short Uber distance and, well, in the end there are great budget hotels that are fun and interesting but broadly speaking, you get what you pay for...in this case, impeccable luxury."
"The St. Regis SF lives up to the brand's reputation and strength. The property is beautiful; the staff are helpful, friendly, and cheerful; and the rooms are polished and well-appointed.Two moments, in particular, stood out. First, the lunch waiter remembered our names--even though he hadn't been our waiter or even interacted with us the day before. WOW. Second, the hotel served fresh juice and iced-tea in the lobby--a lovely touch on a very toasty day.The in-hotel restaurant--Vitrine--was quite wonderful.Pro-tip: the entrance requires a quirky U-turn from a small side alley. Scout out your map before you arrive.One further note. Presumably because of SF real estate prices, the room was relatively small for its price point. If you want room to stretch out, you might need to upgrade yourself."
"Hotel located on the 3rd street, a couple of blocks away from Union Sq. hotels are quite new and very modern.  Bed are very comfort and the rooms are quite big and its definitely very clean.  The double bed room is almost 2 queen bed room, its good for family with kids. Concierge is quite amazing in assisting with restaurant bookings and recommendation. Overall is one of the top choice. "
"Upon arrival we were greeted by Danielle, she was very nice! We were escorted to our suite, and they offered complimentary pressing, which was great. The location of the hotel is ideal; you can walk anywhere from there.The concierges suggestions weren't good. We asked for a good breakfast place and the assistant chef concierge told us about a French place within walking distance (forgot the name), but it was dusty and the service was terrible, we ended up leaving. The weirdest thing happened, when we left, this same concierge saw us and told us to please email his boss to let her know he was great so he could get a promotion... Kind of weird."
"This place makes you feel so well taken care of. I travel often for work and as a female travelling alone, it is a perfect spot. I can go to the spa, for a swim, back to the elegant room or downstairs to the restaurant for an alway-reliably good meal. The price is up there, however, so it's a treat I only allow myself every once in a while. The bonus is that it's part of the Starwood chain, so at least I earn a lot of points for staying there..."
"Beautiful furnishings in a relaxing, luxurious and elegant setting. The perfect retreat from a busy day in San Francisco. The location is very convenient in downtown making it an easy walk to Union Square, The Embarcadero and it is right next door to the Modern Art Museum."
"we stayed on the Metropolitan Suite, beutifull and large, view of san fansico reflects from many big winodws. the new SFMOMA is close by and it is amazing.we got a package that incldes tickets to the musimum and breakfast that was exlent.we had a butler service that arranges coffe and tea when ever requested, but we reqest an expresso machin, somthing that is common on all luxury hotels.In a short time we got it in our suite - excelnt service.The hotel is full of action, the bar is full and lively, and the hotel location is great.A real luxry hotel with excelet service and new beutifull decoration."
A magnificent luxury hotel that does things right. Front desk is totally professional and courteous going out of their way to make sure you get the room you want. They recognized my gold SPG status and did offer a room upgrade. The property is extremely well kept and the people all around are always more than happy to help with anything you may need. The rooms are immaculate and the beds and amenities are perfect.I also appreciated the fully stocked mini bar in the room. A great place to come back to after a long day when all you want to do is kick back and relax. A true five star hotel and experience. 
"Good location, great room and professional staff, however short of a 5 star rating in my opinion. One of my room was not ready until 7pm. No coffee machine in the room (upon demand only, however coffee is free on the 4th floor). Overall a solid property but can improve. Great attentive staff."
"Summary: They tried to put me into a room two categories below what I paid for, despite my loyalty status. This review is mostly about that experience, with some other notes at the bottom. Also, as I write this review, I'm seeing a ""recent review"" from someone named Cindy S, describing an identical experience to mine, one week ago. So this is a recurring pattern. Make sure you get the room you paid for!Some background: I've stayed at this hotel about half a dozen times. I'm fairly familiar with the room types, and I'm an SPG Gold status member. I also booked my reservation through the American Express Fine Hotels and Resorts program, which includes several benefits and amenities - including a free room *upgrade*, when it's available. I've learned not to expect an upgrade, but I was pretty disappointed that they actually downgraded my room by two categories!I booked a Grand Deluxe room, which is two levels above the standard, ""Superior"" room type. (The order is: Superior, Deluxe, Grand Deluxe, Executive Premier.) The rates for a Grand Deluxe room are around $100 higher, per night, than a Superior room. The description of a Grand Deluxe room on the hotel's website says: ""breathtaking views of Yerba Buena Gardens or the San Francisco Bay,"" and ""Grande Deluxe guest rooms are located on floors 7-20."" Additionally, the confirmation email I received says ""park view"" in the room description.By contrast, the description for a Superior room says: ""partial views of picturesque downtown San Francisco,"" and ""located on levels 5-8 of the hotel."" (The website also says Deluxe rooms are on floors 6-18.)I checked in, and when I got in the elevator I noticed that my room number was on the 5th floor. I thought that seemed wrong, but I thought I would check it out anyway. When I opened the shades, I was greeted with a view of...a gravel rooftop, and a brick wall on the other side (the roof was even with the bottom of my windows - I could've walked out onto it, if they opened). I checked the room descriptions to be sure, and concluded that I had been put into a Superior (standard) room. In particular, the hotel's own room descriptions indicate that this is the ONLY room type on the fifth floor.I called the front desk, saying that I wanted to double-check the room category, noting that I had booked a Grand Deluxe room and was expecting a park view and a high floor. The person I spoke to told me that ""some of our Grand Deluxe rooms only have partial city views"" - a statement that directly contradicts both the hotel's own website, and my email confirmation.In the end, I was moved to a room on the 10th floor with a view of Yerba Buena Park. (The room is identical in layout to the Superior room, the only difference is the view.) I'm happy that they corrected the problem, but I'm pretty upset that, had I not raised the issue, I would have been paying $100 extra per night for a room upgrade I wasn't getting! It only adds to my disappointment that I have SPG Gold loyalty status, and that it was a Fine Hotels and Resorts reservation. I feel like the hotel tried to basically cheat me out of a paid upgrade - which I view as stealing, or at least very dishonest - and then when I pointed out the disparity, they lied and told me that room WAS the category I'd paid for.The whole experience somewhat undermines the extremely high, personalized level of service. It makes it seem like the hotel is just being gracious on the surface as they try to pull a fast one on their guests.Other issues: I love the look of the rooms and the service in this hotel, but things are getting a bit run-down. Over several stays here, I've had technical issues with amenities in the room: the most frequent one is issues with the phones, but I've also had problems with TVs, and now in this new room I have a refrigerator that doesn't work. To their credit, the staff has always been helpful in addressing any issues I've had. But this shouldn't happen so frequently. Another note on wear and tear: most of the furniture is starting to look scuffed on the edges, it's not uncommon to encounter a chipped shower door, faucets that are loose, etc - I even had a room with a large crack in the sink once. That type of thing doesn't bother me all that much, but I wanted to note it anyway - it seems this hotel is getting slightly overdue for refreshed decor.Room service is great, the bar serves an excellent Bloody Mary, and the spa is absolutely to-die-for. But a strong suggestion to hotel management - don't con your guests out of upgrades they're paying (significant sums!) for, especially your guests who are loyal members with multiple stays and additional status benefits."
I stayed here once before.  But this is a property that just gets better.  Flawless housekeeping.  Great gym.  French press coffee at 5 am.  Good location.  Incredible hospitality.Breakfast is wonderful but priceyGreat presentationLovely mix of vegetables best oj
"It’s been a few years since I stayed at the St. Regis, and I’m sorry to say both the facilities and service are greatly diminished.  I stayed a couple of nights recently in a one bedroom suite, which proved quite a disappointment for the nearly $1000 per night price.  The suite proved badly in need of repair:  tablet controls for lights and window coverings were mis-wired and non-functional for the duration of the stay; one of the bathroom sinks was clogged and drained very slowly; the room service menu was missing and not replaced (despite explicit notification to the “butler” staff, who seemed more creeplily concerned with unpacking our luggage), and the suite living room featured a large ugly scratch along the hardwood floor.  The suite design itself was less than functional:  the bathroom has neither hooks nor racks for bath towels (they’re kept rolled up in a ball under the sink), and the bedroom closet, with about 24in of hangar space, is probably the smallest I’ve ever encountered in a major hotel, and hardly sufficient for more than an overnight stay.  Staff service was gracious, but not particularly prompt – initial luggage delivery took about 45 minutes after check-in.  Overall, the location is still great, but I’m sure there are superior options for the money in the nearby area."
"The staff is very accommodating and gracious (maybe a little over the top when delivering breakfast).  The rooms are beautiful.  Views of the city are good.  Really love the electronic controls of the shades and lighting, but the climate control didn't work.  The room never got below 72.  Room service is crazy expensive so stay away from that unless you absolutely need to.  Hint - coffee is free on the 4th floor outside the restaurant in the morning.  I didn't discover this until the last day.  Also, check your room.  They tried to put me in a room class below the one I reserved.  Going from Superior to Deluxe room makes a big difference and I highly recommend the upgrade but then definitely make sure you got the deluxe room.  Saw this on another TripAdvisor review, so it may be fairly common practice for this hotel.  Once I pointed it out they moved me graciously.   The amenities in the bath are very nice and the towels and linens luxurious."
Every October we take a trip to San Francisco.  Every year with the exception of 2014 we have stayed here.  That year we didn't it was missed.  The service can't be beat which is why we like staying here.  The rooms are well equipped and spacious.   The quality of the room service is also great.  I highly recommend this hotel if you are ever in San Fran.
"Stayed here for 5 days in May - only issue throughout the entire stay was not being able to check in on arrival, despite arriving after the stated check in time.  That said, we were given a courtesy room to wait in until ours was ready and complimentary breakfast.  During the stay meals were excellent as was housekeeping, gym was great too.  I had asked a couple of times before arriving about personal training as their website said they offered this, but they said it was a mistake and they don't at that hotel.  What they didn't advise however is that you can arrange your own trainer and use the hotel gym.  Overall great location and great service."
"Location location location. It is in the heart of SF, right across the newly expanded SFMOMA and within a short stroll from Union Square and all the shopping and dining the city has to offer.It is what you would come to expect from a St Regis. The service was faultless. The staff were friendly and warm, from the bell hop to the front desk to the ever accommodating concierge, it seems every staff in the hotel are well trained to cater to the needs of their guests.The public places are maintained well, however I find it to be small and was very busy. At the time I was there, patrons were quite loud and there was hardly any place to sit and relax for a quiet drink.The rooms I would say are nice and is of decent size although not impressive. There is a telephone/tablet by the bed side table that controls all the  lights, drapes and music in the room however the speaker is very basic and did not sound good at all.The tablet touchscreen itself isn't very responsive but functional. The water pressure isn't as strong as it could be. Basic toiletries are offered, however in like many hotels these days, dental kits, shaving kits, etc are only available on request. The pool area and gym facilities are quite basic in terms of offerings and design.Although it is one of the more expensive hotels in the city, I believe it is also one of the best."
"true to a 5 star hotel, the room was impeccable. We were greeted with a glass of champagne - very classy - and really enjoyed the room. we had a nice couch in our room - an executive king - a beautiful bathroom with waterfall shower and black out curtains and lights all run by remote - nice!"
"The St. Regis San Francisco was top notch from start to finish.  It is rare that a stay is so 100% seamless, but the visit here was just that.  The hotel has a high end modern design with quality contemporary art, and nice natural materials that even at 10 or so years old now still feels current.  This is a testament that good design matters.  The natural stones and wood finishes that Yabu Pushelberg selected are aging very well and will continue to look good into the future.  The furniture pieces while one can tell they aren't brand new, are simple and classic and do not look dated like so many 'trendy' modern designs that look dated within a couple years.  Service is top notch.  The butler service was informed and prompt.  The concierge team was excellent and handled an on site rental car drop off and pick up with extreme ease.  The guestroom is comfortable, bright, and has automated lights and curtains that many newer luxury hotels still do not have.  The only caveat about the guestroom is ours had only one sink.  I'm not sure if all of the rooms are like this or not, but it caused (very minor) inconvenience when two were trying to get ready at the same time.  The other minor complaint is, food and beverage service in room is expensive.  This comes with the territory of a high end luxury hotel, but I have found St. Regis in room dining to be particularly expensive.  The 'healthy' breakfast was about $45 for one not including tax and service.  Espresso martinis for two were about $60 when factoring in service and gratuity.  All expertly prepared and served promptly though making the price less of an issue."
"The service at the St. Regis is impeccable. All the things you expect at this level of hotel.   This was my second stay in the past year and my room was a total disappointment.   I waited an hour at check in for an upgrade - a room that was supposed to be larger ( by 100 sq. feet ) than one during my prior stay - felt smaller than my last room but perhaps the extra 100 sq feet where in the entry way. I ended up with a corner room (1603) that had very poor lighting ( two small lamps bedside and a low watt lamp in desk to light the entire area - no other lighting other than a couple of ceiling lights behind bed and room was notably dark ) .  Walls were stark white with only one piece of art behind bed.  No sitting chair or sofa and no headboard for bed - so no place to relax and watch TV other than one of the two upright desk chairs. Bathroom small and also poorly lit.  Windows covered with heavy drapes and even when fully open, there was a ton of fabric everywhere.  I I left with a totally different impression than my first visit and would think twice about staying here on a future visit.  The hotel is starting to feel like it needs a guest room renovation soon."
"This hotel has become a staple for me when visiting san francisco.  They always provide a wonderful environment of class and opulence.  Classy and refined, the staff are aways attentive, courteous, and kind.  A special gift was the use of the hotel car for local trips. This was wonderful.  My hats off the the valet staff, they are wonderful and make an amazing first impression.  Thank you for a wonderful visit and will see you soon........"
"We were looking for another hotel lounge that we had visited on another trip.  We ended up here by mistake.  It was okay, nothing great.  I didn't care for the  Hatchet Cider though. The bartender was just okay as well."
"My husband and I stayed at The St. Regis Hotel from May 22 - May 27, 2016, and we are still shaking our heads about this amazing experience!   It was an absolutely, ""One Of A Kind"" experience that everyone should have at least once if they visit or live in San Francisco.Every staff member was  so pleasant and so accommodating, until one would feel the warm atmosphere from the first second one stepped onto the Hotel's grounds and into the lobby until the last second one were to leave the Hotel's premises.  It was EXCEPTIONAL!    The room was immaculate, and the bed was so comfortable--housekeeping service was great!.  The concierges thoroughly answered all of our questions, and made suggestions which helped to make our trip even more enjoyable.  These individuals were so pleasant!Our bellman, Jon Rosenthal, was out of this world!.  Every morning we looked forward to meeting him in the lobby, and we would have our morning talks when he would tell us about different places of interest, whether it would be about a restaurant. catching the cable car, shopping, going down to the Pier, being chauffeured in the Hotel's Bentley (complimentary), or just having a conversation about ""whatever.""  We loved talking with Jon.  We will miss him.!We want to give a special ""thank you"" to  Joanna Stern, who was so accommodating and went beyond the call of duty to assist us. Thank you for everything you did--your kindness and  concern was very much appreciated!   During checkout, there was only a brief conversation with Pierre Redelsperger, but he made a favorable impression.  Of course, the first impression is a lasting impression.Finally, we want to say that we consider this to be the  best hotel experience that we can every recall experiencing.  This was truly a five-star plus experience!Frederick and Doretha Dubose"
"Great rooms, great service and staff. I think the St Regis staff are the most attentive I have ever come across and not to mention they are generally friendly. Their friendliness and quality of service was constant despite their being a conference.Would love to visit again."
"How I absolutely love this hotel, the staff the ambience and attention to details is fantastic! The rooms are to die for, so we'll appointed and luxurious without feeling stuffy! One of my favorite St Regis that I stayed in over the years!! The bathrooms with shutters you can open up to the room to view the entire city in front of you is a great end or start of the day. The concierges makes things happens without any obstacles whatsoever! The location is great too, everything is at your doorstep! Highly recommend this fantastic hotel! "
The hotel is a category 7 by SPG rankings and you will know why if you stay there.   This stay was highlighted by complimentary mimosas throughout the day in the lobby. The staff is top notch and the location is perfect.   I would recommend the hotel for those that can afford it since it's not cheap. 
"This review is long overdue.This hotel hasn't let me down, (resort I should say)I'm a picky guy when I spend 400+ a night on a room. I want to be treated well, I want staff to acknowledge my presence, and I want them to be courteous and kind and helpful and most importantly quick.In a consumers' world, we have to pay attention to detail. Otherwise the providers will become lazy..At the St. Regis, attention to detail is not a problem. To say the least, they go overboard.All the rooms are cleaned to perfection before arrival, I've stayed here a total of 6 times and have never found something from the room ""before""Room service is of 4-5 Star quality food, hot and ready and fresh.Do not tip the room service, the gratuity is already factored in. Unless you feel like splurging.Amazingly well done eentree choices ordered directly to your room..The reason I go to hotels, is to escape life, go to the spa, sit in my room, watch movies, and be waited on.This hotel does it all.For a Price.a 3 day ultimate vacation as I like to call it, room service once a day, and the spa once a day,Can easily run you over 2000-3000 Dollars here.If you want to just enjoy the room and resort, you can get away with spending 900-1200 on a room for 3 nights and just enjoying yourself.My first stay here was with a Mercedes Benz Voucher way back in the day.Thanks Mercedes Benz, you introduced me to a fantastic resort!"
"My husband and I love the St Regis hotels and this time that we are traveling with or kids, they also got to experience it! Wished it had a breakfast buffet and in-room coffee machine though, really thought it was a hassle having to call for a pot when you just want your caffeine in the morning, right out of bed. "
"I recently stayed here for several days while on business.  Based on previous experiences with the St. Regis brand, I expected a lot from this hotel, and it did not disappoint.  The service here is one of the best I've experienced.  People seemed genuinely interested in helping and attending to my needs.  Little things, like returning my shined shoes in shoe trees, were greatly appreciated.  Another example was housekeeping.  I like to lay out my toiletries in a neat and organized way, and they not only kept it organized, they made it even neater!  I only ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant, but the food and service were excellent.  They make a great Bloody Mary -- very spicy, but that's the way I like it.  The fitness center is well equipped.  I hate going to places where there is not enough equipment and this was never a problem here.  The location is perfect, and there is the use of a house car [normally a Bentley, but it was out of service when I stayed, so it was just a BMW] for short trips.  Very convenient for going out to dinner.  I gave the hotel 5 stars, but there are some areas for improvement.  The closet is a bit small, especially for 2 people.  There is no charging station near the bed.  They have a central control unit, but it doesn't allow you to turn on/off individual lights.  If you go, try to get a room that is higher up and faces east for the views.  This is a great place to stay, but all of this does not come cheap.  If you're able to get someone to pay for it, that's great, but if not, just be aware of the cost and know that it's worth every penny."
St Regis is a luxury hotel and certainly not cheap. The location is great very close to the ocean and just off market street. The only problem I had was that the wifi in the rooms was very patchy and did not get fixed despite repeated requests.
"The St Regis is centrally located, next to the SF Museum of Modern Art, walking distance to Union Square and the financial district. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable. The service throughout the hotel is impeccable. The gym is available 24 hours with many options for cardio workouts but I'd limited in terms of weight machines. The bar is the lobby was a great option for pre-dinner drinks. This will be my first choice for hotels on my next trip to San Fransisco. "
"Always a great hotel.Great staff and service.Great location.Sfmoma just re-opened, so a perfect location close next door.Walking distance to everything.  Transportation also an easy option.You can never miss."
"My husband and I stayed here recently so he could attend a conference at the Moscone Center nearby.  I wanted a place that was upscale and comfortable and he needed a place that was within walking distance of his conference.  The St. Regis met and exceeded my expectations.  My daughter recently moved to San Francisco so I accompanied my husband on this business trip to help her get settled.  We had a fabulous breakfast in the hotel restaurant each morning.  We were greeted by name each time (not sure how they remembered as I can barely remember my room number).  The room quality was top notch.  Pristine accommodations, the bed was fabulously comfortable, soft sheets and large towels in the overly large bathroom.  The black out shades were so nice and the electronics controlling the lighting, climate and shades were very handy.  It really was a luxury to be able to return here each evening after an exhausting day.  Turn down service each night and honestly, we were here a week and I loved every minute.  I will be sure to return to this hotel on my next visit."
I stayed at the hotel in April 2016. The room facility was good. They have a large gym that's open 24 hours. Unfortunately it's in the city and the rooms are small facing buildings around you. The garden side not facing another building was having a construction work so I stayed at the city view. I d strongly recommend that you stay at higher floors above 13 f so you won't see another building in front of you. Overall I stayed at other 5 star hotels in Sf  but the service quality is best among them. The butlers helped a lot for my personal issues. I d definitely go back there when I go to sf again. 
"I stayed there few years back- better than the 2 ones I stayed recently in. The thing is... if people are busy exploring the city or attending the conferences, who really has time to enjoy the hotel?I recall the receptionist being very nice."
"This is our go-to hotel for opera and symphony in SF. Depending on other cultural events, we stay one or two nights five or six times a year. We opt for the Metropolitan Suite which is super spacious, elegant and comfortable with great views and such a treat. Breakfast in bed, yay! Service is excellent and kindly. Room service isvway better than most such offerings. There is the sense staff will go the extra mile for you. I 'm not wild about the decor (which is aimed at a younger demographic) but the comfort is undeniable and it beats the heck out of the Ritz-Carlton since that hotel's recent make-over."
"We stayed at St Regis on my husband's bday! We live in Marin and know the city well, the whole purpose was to have a gateway- and we did! The hotel was ultra accomodating, we got an upgrade to the Executive premier room with a wonderful view. Chocolate strawberries and champagne were prompt while my husband was getting pampered at the Remede spa. Ultra attentive staff made the stay wonderful! Thank you St Regis for delivering a true 5 star experience! The only negatives were 1) rusted handicap chair at the pool takes the zen away of an otherwise sublime space and 2) too hot in the room- woke up sweating several times- need an extra light comforter for those who don't want to put the AC at 55!"
"This is an excellent hotel in San Francisco.  I was greeted upon arrival and taken to check in.  The front desk personnel were all very courteous and welcoming.  My room was impeccable; I had a beautiful corner room with large windows.  My bed was comfortable, the bathroom was spacious, and the entire room was very clean.  I asked the concierge, Eric, for a restaurant recommendation and he gave me several choices.  I ultimately chose a sushi restaurant, Eric made a reservation for that night, and the food was delicious.  The cocktail waitress, Paveena, was amazing.  She was always prompt when I wanted another drink, and once she knew I had dinner reservations, she went to the front of the hotel and reserved the hotel car to drive me--that's really excellent customer service.  I ordered room service for breakfast and it was on time and delicious.  The room service attendant was friendly and set everything up for me.  I don't have a single criticism of this hotel or the staff.  Everything was truly first rate."
"Stayed here for only one night. It was very pleasant. Room decor was warm and modern, room was clean and in-room dining was delivered fast and professionally. Besides, the food was awesome! The staff was friendly and accommodating. Would definitely come back again!"
"Prior to our arrival Michael, the Chief Concierge, had arranged for a Mercedes from Hertz to be dropped off for our trip after our three night stay. Extremely convenient! He also helped with dining reservations. The entire staff was at the top of their game. Having access to a ""house car"" when not in use by other guests was an enormous benefit. The staff in the spa and the spa facilities get a strong A grade. My masseuse, who originally was from Canada was superb. The bar has good vibes. The St, Regis is within walking distance of several James Beard award winning restaurants. Will be back!"
"The staff were great.  Christian at the front desk was terrific and truly offered a luxury experience.  Housekeeping staff did a great job and were nice enough to run my wife's bath prior to returning to the hotel (several times, sorry).  Private dining breakfast was not the best but again the attendant was very accommodating.  We didn't have a chance to experience the spa and pool.  Only negative feedback would be that the windows were not soundproof.  Overall a very pleasant stay and would return."
"Very welcoming staff upon arrival, and upgrade offered so we got a lovely corner suite with great views.  Bed very comfortable, nice bathroom with lots of toiletries and plenty of  towels (why are some hotels so stingy with towels??).  Staff friendly and try very hard to please.  One strange thing, for a very roomy suite, the wardrobe is tiny!!!  We left the majority of our clothes in our suitcase as the hanging space is very small and is shared with the ironing board and robes."
"Modern high rise hotel in Financial District. Next door to SF Museum of Modern Art. Walking distance of California Street restaurants. Rooms decorated in natural wood with a refined Scandinavian aura of calm.  Beds comfortable, WiFi easy to access, aircon excellent. Lavish toiletries. Towels soft. Excellent turndown service.  A hotel that's been built with plenty of elevators - there's always one waiting in the lobby. ( How do they manage it when just about every other hotel on the planet can't ? ). Check in was one of those South West Air type experiences - would I like a suite at only $500 a night extra ? Would I like the FT for $10 ? - but after that everything was smooth and calm and professional. My new favourite in SF . Paid $500 a night which I thought was very reasonable for the quality and service provided. On departure my flight to Paris was delayed and they volunteered ( rather than having to ask for ) a late check out. A professional kindness / courtesy that will be remembered."
"Great place.  I've stayed there twice for SF staycations just to get away with girlfriends. Rooms are great, beds are AMAZINGLY comfortable, lots of rooms with great views. Lounge/bar has a nice menu. We ate dinner there both times, but at two different restaurants (they've just opened a new one.)  As usual, the menu was VERY meat heavy (I'm a vegetarian) but I was thrilled that they actually have a separate vegetarian menu.  Food was delicious, decent wine list.  Pool is a good size.Breakfast could be a bit better.  I don't love the choices they offer, but generally it's okay. I  have a ""thing"" about spending so much on breakfast in hotels.  Hotel breakfasts always cost a fortune and they are simply never that good.  St. Regis is hardly unique in that, but I still find it annoying. Especially as the dinner was soooo delicious!All in all a great place though, and highly recommended."
"A classy, trendy hotel with a touch of luxury. The St Regis hotel is definitely one of my favourite hotels of all time. The location is perfect as its walking distance from some of the main shopping areas and some of the cities' best restaurants. They do charge for valet parking though but their service is great. For those who love club sandwiches from the in-room dining menus. Try their St Regis Club Sandwich its got local crab in it and its great!The staff are friendly and if your heading off to another sister hotel from within their family.. I am sure the team will take care of you! Keep up the great work St Regis San Francisco! "
This is a top notch place to stay. The thing that impressed me the most was the service. I need to travel home with breastmilk and was having a hard time locating a place that was open that sold dry ice and the concierge located a place for me. That were very accommodating to my needs as a nursing mother. I was traveling without my baby and they held my breastmilk in their freezer for our stay. They even came up to retrieve it each time I needed them to. Rooms are very nice. Everything you need is there. Beds are super comfortable. Would highly recommend.
"The St. Regis in San Francisco has been my hotel of choice when visiting this awesome city.  It has never disappointed.  From the moment I arrive until the very moment of my departure, the staff at the hotel make you feel like you are the only guest at the hotel.  Special kudos to the concierge staff who remember me each time I check in.  I highly recommend this hotel anytime you are in the area."
"Waiting for reopening of sfmoma, stayed 2 nights as a trial. Disappointed that restaurant was closed since last visit.  Otherwise, hotel lives up to 5 * Stan card.   Combe i.e. T for SOMA.  Bathrooms are just top notch..Lobby bar is a nice meeting place."
"Whether staying at St. Regis or visiting the city, visit the beautiful property's new restaurant The Grill. Enjoyed a great evening with friends. Server was attentive and friendly. Manager Maxime was charming and epitomized five star service. Every dish was a beautiful presentation and each flavor did not disappoint. Fish cooked to perfection. Hotels Executive Chef, Franck was visible and engaging guests. P.S. Don't forget dessert .... Loved the Baked Alaska, can't wait to return!"
"Our metropolitan suite wasn't ready when we arrived at 11am, but we were told they'd put a rush on it. Everything seemed very busy - people were getting a bit frustrated waiting in line at check in. 4 hours later, the normal check-in time passed and we started to get a bit irritated. But like any outstanding hotel would, they dealt with the problem by upgrading us. So we were in one of those really nice St Regis suites. The room was truly amazing. Wonderful space, nicely decorated. the service was exemplary. Desk staff knew our name, room service staff were friendly and very helpful. The chauffeur from the airport was also wonderfully helpful and friendly. The bathroom had a great rainshower head and about a million towels. Remede products were good but smelled a bit medicinal. The dental kits had decent toothpaste and a simple toothbrush. The shave kits had a reasonable razor (for a hotel shave kit) but weird cream that didn't really foam up. The hairdryer was decent for a hotel (i.e., it actually dried our hair). The gym was large and well equipped - 4 running machines with one out of service. But I was the only visitor so it hardly mattered. The room service menu seemed a little limited - it was hard to find a small simple light snacks or something that we just felt like, but the lounge downstairs had some nice options. We would recommend it to friends and we would stay again if we get back to San Francisco (if we have saved up the bazillions it costs!)"
"We recently stayed here for 5 nights.  The hotel is lovely, beautiful rooms and amenities.  The service was excellent and the location can't be beat.  We were able to walk everywhere and there are tons of nearby attractions for children.  Highly recommend and we will definitely return."
"I've stayed at a number of hotels in San Francisco included the W, Ritz-Carlton, among others but the St Regis always satisfies. The room is tastefully decorated and the staff is very helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel.Of all the hotels I've stayed at in this city, the St Regis is at the top."
"After spending a few days in San Diego for a conference, my husband and I decided to travel to San Francisco.  We wanted to celebrate my birthday and my husband  booked a room at the St. Regis.  Through the Starwood Platinum program we were able to upgrade our room to an Astor Suite.  As a guest in a suite we received impeccable service, a fabulous room and enjoyed this so much we could have remained in the hotel for the entire stay.  Our delightful butler Pavel showed us to our room, which was a corner room with floor to ceiling windows, stylish decor and spectacular views.  As someone who has never had a butler, and wasn't sure what to expect, we were pleasantly surprised at the ease and comfort of this service.  The hotel dedicates one person to see to your needs.  Pavel was helpful, but not pretentious.  On the actual day of my birthday he left a hand written birthday card, bottle of champagne set up on ice, and plate of hand made chocolates with Happy Birthday written in chocolate.  The hotel tradition is to perform a champagne saber at 5pm on Thurs, Fri and Saturday.  In the tradition of Napolean and the Astor family, the sommelier takes a fine bottle of champagne and with one whack of a saber decapitates the bottle allowing us to enjoy the fruits of his labor.  This was a unique and grand experience.  The hotel staff was also attentive to our needs.  At one point we were caught in a windy rainstorm and entered the lobby.  At the front desk they offered us hand towels to help dry ourselves.  We could go on about the experience including the salt water pool, live fresh flowers in our suite, ease of location, free garment pressing, but recommend experiencing the St. Regis for yourself.  If you are looking to travel in style or celebrate a special occasion, you can't go wrong at the St. Regis San Francisco."
"My boyfriend and I stayed here early November 2015 because we wanted to see what it was like (he typically likes to stay at the W down the street because it has a fun night life). This hotel was immaculate! The rooms were beautiful and the service was great! We loved sitting at the bar near the hotel entrance- they had some really delicious and interesting drinks, and great food (even if you do not stay at this hotel, stop in and have a drink)."
"Traveled in Bay Area and SF for years, and tried bulk of hotels and restaurant.Despite everything, i think St Regis is the best hotel in town.Great view from almost every single room, outstanding service, gym pool and free-wifi.Breakfasts are a la carte but anyway delicious."
"Rooms were not that great, not luxury, comfy but not what you paid for. Staff well trained,  I must say highly trained, however, even than service was perfect for a room over $400 US you certainly expect more than just great service, it should be bother amazing and services and amazing rooms; here it is not balanced"
The room was very nice and larger than most others in the area.  The staff was very friendly and always provided great service.  I liked the smart home controls where you can control the lights and blinds.  I have only experienced it in luxury hotels in South East Asia.
"As Expected:The hotel itself is what I imagine when I think St. Regis. Modern, elegant, luxurious, comfortable and classy. The interior design is just right from the public to private spaces. I especially like the acrylic handles in the bath space. The view is lovely. The rooms are just well done. Pleasantly Surprised:A huge cold front blew through the last evening we were there so we dined at the ""grill"", St. Regis's restaurant. This is no knock on St. Regis but generally I find hotel restaurants lacking across the board. The grill surprised me on all accounts from stellar entrees (Colorado Lamb chops) and dessert (honey crisp apple), service and ambiance. The service was on point, quick to clean up, there when we needed and appropriately absent when we were enjoying our meal. While checking out, the manager said the restaurant was a ""pop up"" meaning they would be implementing a new restaurant later. I don't know St. Regis, you have something pretty amazing going on now, don't fix what's not broken."
"Of the ten or so hotels I've stayed in in San Fran, the St. Regis is my favorite. Great location, lovely lobby and bar, and sleek modern rooms. Restaurants always left something to be desired, but looks as though a new one just opened. The service is top notch and the concierge is stellar. Sadly, like everything else in SF, the rates have gone up significantly so I don't get to stay there as often."
"As a family stay in the summer, we had a great time staying for the 4th time at the St Regis SF. The location of the hotel is centrally located, and all the staff are friendly and welcoming, especially the very knowledgeable concierge team.The rooms feel large and spacious, featuring modern technology and design. It was a shame that the wifi wasn't great towards the back of the room.We will definitely return here next time we are in SF."
"'Surprise, Surprise, Surprise' ... No this is not a Gomer Pyle review of an amazing dish by a simple minded person but a simplistic approach to making one of the best cooked Aussie Racks of Lamb with just Salt and Pepper coupled with an amazing 2012 Malbec (Cantena) balanced well with low acidity on the finish (my preference too) The key here...Fresh, never frozen was the guess and likely organic grass fed judging by the amount of fat on the rack.  Grab the sommelier and don't skimp on the pairing so you taste this combo in your memory for weeks.  Price was high but who cares when the food and service makes it easy for the boss to pay!  Take a client, the food is simple and gastro-delish ...one critique, my client was a baked Alaska guru and this petite tasty desert was missing its flaming cognac kissing cousin...the client is always right at a business dinner. St. Regis Grill...make the adjustment to end a killer meal with a killer desert. Enjoy! "
"Excellent, friendly service from the minute I checked in until checkout. I'm have little SPG status but was treated well nonetheless. Room was very comfortable and clean with some nice luxury features, including a large bathroom (with a great shower!!). Definitely will try to stay here again on my next visit to San Fran. "
"Since we only stayed for one night, leaving for the next day for the Monterey Peninsula, I can only report good things based on this brief stay.Service is outstanding here.  We had not stayed at the St. Regis in several years and it's only improved.  Rooms are still elegant and modern.  Our request for extra towels was met upon our arrival.  A bathroom clogged drain was repaired in a very short time.All staff could not have been more accomodating and pleasant, making this a terrific start of our vacation. Having stayed in most four and five star hotels in SF, I'd recommend the St. Regis as the best of them all."
"My boyfriend and I were celebrating Valentine's Day last week on Sunday, Feb 14th. Initially he booked a room at The Ritz Carlton at Half Moon Bay because it is closer to where my family lives and it has a spectacular view, and overall, this resort is incredible. But I suggested to stay at St.Regis instead because I am a Starwood Platinum member and I want to get all the benefits for being a Platinum member. Unfortunately, our expectation to stay at this most expensive Starwood Brand hotel in the city was NOT met at the very beginning. When we checked in, I asked if we can get all the benefits as a Platinum member to the front desk staff (if I'm not wrong, his name is Christian), he told us that he could give us room upgrade but I could NOT get the points because I did not pay to stay at the hotel. My boyfriend paid for the room but he is not a Platinum member. I was surprised by his answer because so far when both of us stayed at the any SPG hotels in the country, there was never a problem like this. He then called a manager (I think they called him a Starwood specialist). The manager also insisted and kept telling me that I could NOT get the points. Even worse, the manager told us that we could have a free complimentary breakfast but only this time AS A COURTESY of him and we could NOT get any extra points from spending extra money at the restaurants either. Then I heard one of them mentioned about 3x if the points applied to me (as a Platinum member) and 2x if the points applied to my boyfriend's SPG account (because I could actually get more points but since I did not pay so I did not deserve to get the points????). The manager then told me that he guaranteed I WILL NOT get the points. I then stopped asking questions after I realized that we've spent about 30 minutes at the front desk and we did not want to miss our dinner reservation at Ame restaurant. Basically we did not want the entire night of our Valentine's day celebration totally ruined and we want to enjoy the rest of the night and morning at this hotel. I then called SPG and asked about clarification, the staff told me that it's all depends on the person/front desk staff. SPG wants to avoid giving points to a member who did not stay at the property, so it is an assumption that whoever paid would actually stay. The SPG staff then credited me all the points and even added MORE POINTS to my account and thanked me for being a loyal SPG member. These 2 gentlemen were probably right about the points and both of them probably got 4.0 GPA at school, but in reality especially if you run a business, you have to have flexibility. We came as a couple, it was a Valentine's day, both of us stayed at the hotel and if you guys still choose to argue over petty things that did not cost you anything instead of appreciate our business and thinking about providing the best customer service under one of the most luxurious Starwood Hotel umbrella The St Regis Hotel, I want to say that SHAME ON YOU! What you don't not realize is if this hotel gets less and less business because of bad reviews and ratings, you could potentially lose your job. So good luck with your super RUDE, arrogant behavior!*****REMEMBER: The Customer is ALWAYS RIGHT*****"
"Having stayed at over a dozen hotels in San Francisco, I have a decent understanding of what is available. The St. Regis San Francisco still managed to exceed my expectations primarily due to extraordinary service and treatment by the staff. Stayed there with my family for 4 nights. Had a bit of confusion before our stay began, but the staff stepped up and made everything ""better than right"". I learned that this is a hotel that will go above and beyond to take care of you - I experienced several instances that really surprised me. The hotel itself is beautiful and luxurious, the food (restaurants and room service) was excellent, the room was very very nice, and the service was incredible. The location is very central and also good for walking to various places in the city. The pool and spa are quite nice as well. Top notch and highly recommended."
My wife and I just spent 4 nights at the St. Regis and it was a wonderful stay.  The hotel itself is very beautiful.  There is a striking modern lobby.  The rooms are very spacious with excellent city views.  There is also a high quality spa and a 50 foot indoor infinity pool.  The staff is outstanding at every level.  Particular praise goes to the concierge team.  Caroline and Mariah offered us great advice and helped make wonderful plans.  I recommend this hotel as the perfect place to stay in San Francisco.
The hotel is not bad but they could offer a much better experience.The welcoming was very impersonal and the staff members were not very friendly.The rooms were nice but the closets were so small and not enough space to hung yours clothes.Also they were very bad organised its the breakfast. They had a conference at the hotel and everyone from the conference end to have breakfast with the normal guests and I had to wait one hour for a table and this is actually unacceptable.
"I used to really enjoy staying at this property and realized that, sadly, that doesn't always mean you will in the future. I had saved up SPG points for a return stay this February and at high cost found a clean but lackluster, dated and slightly musty-smelling room; very pedestrian recommendations from one of the concierge team that never wowed and Google exceeded; an impossible hunt for any degree of service in their soul-less but stylish lobby (including coffee at 8:30am or food past 9:30pm); and an empty restaurant that meant I ended up at the nearby Subway for dinner. Shame on you The St. Regis; did Marriott take over already?!?! "
Absolutely fabulous SF hotel one of my favorites for business travel. First rate service and the rooms are stunning. The staff here is always the best of any hotel in the city. I recommend this hotel without reservation!!
"Definitely not a 5 star experience by any means. Room less than what I would expect, large chips in marble, vanity light not working, fridge not turned on, room control panel faulty, no coffee/tea in room.  Only one bottle of water left for a couple (requested more and did receive it) but at a minimum two bottles would be expected.However it is a good central location but my two other St Regis experiences (Hawaii and Tahiti) have been exceptional.  I would signet looking elsewhere for the money you spend."
"My wife and I stayed at the St. Regis and were generally impressed.  It's a lovely, stylish hotel in a great downtown San Francisco location.  The staff were all solicitous and responsive (with an exception - see below in my comments about lighting control).  Our room was on the 14th floor and had a good view looking north.  The room was spacious and the bed was large (a king or California king) and pretty comfortable.  There was a large tub with door panels that could be opened to take advantage of the view.So why only rating it 4 instead of 5?First, while stylish, the room design was not practically thought out.  Here are some of the less than ideal features of our room:The closet door didn't close well.Only one towel bar in the bath area and not as much area to put things down there as a traveler might like.  The shower was enclosed in frosted glass.  You had to close a door to prevent water from spraying out into the rest of the bath area.  It had a ceiling fixture and a second wall mounted one.  Neither of us used the ceiling unit.  There were no grab bars in the shower or near the tub.  The tub was deep enough where it would have been nice to have something to use to assist getting up and similarly, it would have been nice to have something hold onto in the shower.The lights had conventional switches but are also controlled by a tablet computer.  While I can see the value of being able to turn off all of the lights from one location, why the designers of this system allowed control to individual lights from the tablet (without any explanation of this in the written information in the room) puzzled me.  We couldn't turn on one of the bedside lights and I even called the front desk about this.  All I got was an apology and a promise to send someone up to check it out.  I was away from the room for a few hours and came back to the light not working.  I figured out what was going on myself.  That the person I spoke to could not explain what was going on is surprising.The ""do not disturb"" method was poorly thought out.  Instead of something that could be hung from a door handle like at most hotels, there was an electronic control near the door.  I used it because I was going out on a quick errand and didn't want to come back to the room being made up.  When I returned my room key card did not work!  I had to call the front desk and someone from security came up to unlock the door.  It seems to me that my room key should have been coded to allow me back into my room.The clothes closet was inconveniently placed near the window, next to the desk which didn't leave much room to get into it.None of these problems were major, but I think had the designers of the hotel given more thought to function over style, we would have had a more comfortable stay."
"Most of the time I do stay at trendy hotels and anything what I call heavy luxury is not what I would be looking for, but St Regis San Francisco is different. This is truly how modern luxury hotel should look like. The location is truly central and you can walk anywhere downtown San Francisco easily. The hotel is beautiful with local art as any St Regis hotel, but most importantly the staff was the key to our great stay. Anytime you met a staff member somewhere, they simple looked at you and said hi. The attention of detail while cleaning the room, simply amazing. Once we sat at the bar and I kept looking at the paintings and the waitress was able to explain to me what is going on in these paintings, wow. Rooms simply great with attention to detail to bed quality, amenities and the little things you simply do not find in many hotels. Eggs Benedict at breakfast, best I ever had. Simply said, if there is something like modern luxury, where you do not feel the heaviness of service and old school stuff, this is it."
"We stayed at the St Regis for an overnight stay, attending a wonderful evening gala that was taking place at the hotel. We were staying in an Executive Suite, and that was a very rewarding experience. Professional and friendly staff at the reception, great atmosphere in the lobby common areas, very nice ballroom, not to forget the very attentive and dedicated hearted service from the doormen at the bottom of the hotel."
The St.Regis in San Francisco is a 5 star hotel with the service one would expect when staying at a deluxe hotel. The guest rooms are well decorated and very functional with great amenities. Housekeeping is excellent and the attention to detail is very good. I could tell that all the staff was well trained and very friendly. We had a small issue with the AC as the weather was unusually warm. Within minutes after advising the operator of the issue an engineer was at our door and fixed the issue.The St.Regis is one of the finest hotels we have experienced in many visits to San Francisco over the past 45 years.
"We stayed one night at the St. Regis during the height of Super Bowl madness and we were pleasantly surprised by the hotel. The lobby bar was packed and the hotel was full, but the room was quiet and very comfortable. My husband forgot his toothbrush and one was delivered within minutes. The bed linens and towels were plush and very soft. We had a nice view but the layout of the room was a little strange- I think it was an atypical room layout on the end of the floor. My only other complaint was the lack of any art on the walls or anything to make the room more inviting. It was meant to be understated but it felt a little cold and industrial with white walls and lots of windows.Our checkout was smooth and the valets were knowledgeable and friendly despite the chaos of the crowd. I would recommend the hotel and hope next time that I had a room with a little more charm."
"Beautiful hotel with a very prime location. It's a good experience comparing to US standards. Rooms are with good size. The bar in the lobby is usually busy with a nice atmosphere. The breakfast is also good. Staff are strong, confident and super friendly. However, overall, nothing so outstanding. It's a nice 5 star hotel but I don't think it reflects that luxury element of st. Regis. "
"Modern and classical decor, perfectly balanced. Elegant and sophisticated, as you'd expect from a St. Regis. The room was spacious and had really nice amenities. Wow, I loved the bathrobe! SO SOFT! Huge bathroom, with shower and a jacuzzi tub.The bar is a great place for meetings and tends to be a power scene. My only complaint is that the bar closed very early on the Sunday night when I last arrived. There is complimentary coffee on the mezzanine. Simple, important touch!"
"My travel partner still raves about our stay at the St. Regis in Mauritius a few years ago. So when we planned a stay in San Francisco before an Alaska Cruise, I booked two nights at the St. Regis. Some stays at St. Regis city hotels elsewhere gave me confidence that we would have an equally fantastic experience. About a week before our arrival, the hotel’s guest liaison sent me an email stating how excited they were about our upcoming stay. Well, once we arrived there, there wasn’t much left of their excitement. No doorman greeted us and helped with the luggage. It’s all ‘help yourself’. Although guest liaison had asked about our arrival time and I had informed them that we would arrive between 2 and 3pm, no room was ready at 2:30pm. The receptionist worked on the computer for quite a while until a room was found. There wasn’t any spg Platinum recognition: no upgrade, no welcome letter, no butler to bring us tea upon arrival (a feature I loved so much at other St. Regis hotels). Well, I am fully aware that US properties are often of a lower standard than the international properties of the same brand and I do adjust my expectations accordingly. But this hotel was a bit of a disappointment. The spg ‘You-made-my-stay’ recognition certificates that I made sure to bring along remained unused. Don’t get me wrong, the hotel is ok. We had a nice room. It just didn’t meet my expectations and I think it’s not worth the price."
"i have stayed in many hotels in SF and I really enjoyed this one.  It does not have the old school charm that many of the San Francisco hotels have, but it does have a new sophistication that is refreshing.   Great for if your events are focused in Yueba Buena Park, but proximate to several SF attractions.  "
"If you are in San Fransisco on business, there is no better place to stay in town! Recently stayed in the St Regis for a 2 night business meeting en route to Bellevue, WA. The staff at this hotel went above and beyond to make sure that I had everything I needed in order to make my stay more enjoyable. Since most of my time was spent in my room, the room service was amazing and the concierge staff had some great suggestions on restaurants and great meeting spots in town. I'm headed to Napa in April for my anniversary and I am seriously thinking about stoping in for a few nights just to visit the St. Regis."
"We had a splendid stay at the St. Regis. The concierge was very helpful with restaurants & the best attractions to see. The room was beautiful! And the arranged for us to be driven to our restaurant in a Bentley, which was owned by the hotel!"
"Stayed here for a weekend with my husband. The hotel is what I'd expect from a St. Regis - rooms are very comfortable and quiet. The hotel has a great location and the staff is friendly and helpful. The concierge did a great job of getting us into a restaurant where we hadn't been able to get a reservation on our own (thank you!). My only suggestion / annoyance is the 4th floor breakfast place. The menu is so unoriginal and the prices are really high. I expected the high breakfast prices, that's typical of any similar quality hotel, but the menu was just so boring. The boring menu is sort of made worse by the fact that it's San Francisco, which is such a foodie city. At least add some berries to the pancakes, don't charge extra for the fruit for oatmeal, etc. If the menu had been more interesting, then I might have eaten here again, just because of convenience."
"Great business hotel, it's not in a super crowded area but still close enough to market street and union square to walk. The hotel feels luxurious, private and was quite quiet when I was staying.  Rooms are spotless, furnished in the usual St Regis style. No complaints!"
"The hotel is very nice. I really liked the bathroom in our room.  It felt a little like any other nice hotel. Nothing was standout. Our room was on the same floor as the pool so there were people constantly walking by our room in various levels of undress that was inappropriate.  Also, there was a conference going on while we were there that we were not a part of so hey seemed to take over the lobby and bar."
"I made our reservation for 8 nights through the St. Regis reservation desk.  The clerk that assisted me with this was very helpful and we used the holiday special buy 3 nights get 1 free.  We reserved 2 rooms, 1 double and 1 suite paying for 6 nights total.  I was assured by the clerk that by using our Platinum American Express card that we would be eligible for the upgrade if available. Upon checking in we were told that in fact we ineligible for the upgrade and our breakfast credit was only good in the restaurant, no room service.  On day 3 after I complained to the front desk that we had to wait 20 minutes for a table at breakfast they informed me that of course we could use our breakfast credit in our room.  Once again 2 different answers.  Our suite looked tired, the couch cushions were from 2 different couches (different fabrics) the dining table was so wobbly we had to warn anyone that walked by it to be careful, the welcome amenity was 4 pieces of fruit.  All surfaces were nicked and chipped and just old and tired looking.  Not what you would expect from a hotel with a 5 star rating.  I spoke with the hotel manager about my disappointment from the mixed messages regarding the upgrades to the pitiful welcome amenity.  He graciously sent a nice bottle of wine, cheese, and some cookies for the kids the following day (day 3)  You would think that the hotel would have done something nice on New Years Eve for their guests - nothing.  Not even a heads up that SF has fireworks and we would be able to view them from our room!  The room service was very slow to retrieve the carts, on several occasions it sat for more than 3 hours.  One evening we asked for the wine glasses/ice bucket to removed while we were at dinner but we returned to our room and the mess. About 15 years ago I used to stay at the SR a couple times a year and it was always a dreamy experience from the staff to the rooms.  Unfortunately the staff is mediocre (except for the concierge) and the rooms are in desperate need of a make over.  Its ok to charge top $$ if you have the staff, accommodations, and amenities to back it up.  I wouldn't recommend if you are looking for a 5 star experience - this was more like a 3."
"This hotel is on par with the best of the St. Regis properties.  The hotel is in a fantastic location just south of Union Square in the SOMA neighborhood.  What makes St. Regis properties superior is their service and this property delivers on all aspects of service. From the efficient and friendly check-in folks, to the friendly doormen, to the knowledgeable concierges, all the staff were exceptional and went out of their way to make the stay special.  We were celebrating my daughter's birthday and the hotel even surprised us by delivering a small birthday cake and a hand written note to our room.  That personal touch was perfect! The rooms have extremely comfortable beds with well pressed linens and the bathrooms are large with a separate stall shower with rainfall shower heads along with a separate detachable shower head. Turn down services is always a nice touch and I've always found the St. Regis does this with class making the room extremely welcoming after a return from dinner.  I was extremely impressed and will return here again."
When in San Francisco stay at St.Regis. I love this hotel. Service here is superb. One evening while we were having dinner at their Ame restaurant I wanted to get dessert but didn't want to stay and wait for dessert to be done since it needed some time to be prepared. I was super tired and we had a long day. They immediately suggested sending their butler to our room once my dessert was ready. Few minutes later knock on our door. Dessert is ready..Great service. Rooms are specious and clean. Great views. Can't wait to return.
"We were happy with our upper level, contemporary corner room that overlooked a garden. The bar is very attractive and popular. Vitrine, the breakfast restaurant, was a real treat, and one of the best breakfasts we have had in any hotel. A ride in the hotel Bentley to a nearby restaurant was fun too. Our only complaint is with Ame restaurant at the hotel. It may have earned a Michelin star at some point, and aside from excellent service, the menu was very limited and there is no excuse for tough pork chops. The SF Museum of Modern Art reopens in a few months and it's next door to the hotel."
"I stayed here for 5 nights with my husband and two dogs and it was such a great stay! impeccable service, friendly staff, and great location. they have little touches that go a long way, such as bringing me my favorite tea in the room every afternoon, bringing treats for the dogs, etc. I highly recommend the st regis SF!"
"I took the luxury of the hotel for granted. What really impressed me is how seamlessly and properly everything worked - the room was made exactly on time (which mattered a lot, since we used the suite for interviews), the billing was exactly right the first time around, nothing had to asked for twice. And yes, the suites are really nice :-)"
"We once again took advantage of our SPG status and booked a deluxe room and were upgraded to a grand deluxe room. Didn't even have to ask for it! Typically the St. Regis has a more classic luxury look. The San Francisco hotel puts a modern twist to that and does it wonderfully. As soon as you enter the lobby, you see the lounge/bar as well as a nice waiting area. Check in is a little further inside. Without our SPG status, the offer was breakfast for 2 each morning of your stay ($30/person in room) + $100 property credit. So it was a great deal! We eat room service twice and had Sunday Brunch at Vitrine. Sadly, the Michelin star restaurant Ame, just changed their menu and we weren't as intrigued as the old one so we skipped it. Our room was on the 16th floor and had a great view of Yerba Buena Gardens. The room is sleek, modern, and elegant. If you're looking for elegance and a relaxing stay, this is definitely your hotel. Only a 5 min walk to the Montgomery St. BART and convenient to the city of San Fran."
beautiful rooms and public areas. great indoor pool and spa. i have stayed at the St R several times and the staff recognizes me upon each return.  impressive. service is top notch and the cocktail lounge provides super drinks and a view onto busy 3rd street. corner suites are lux and spacious.
"Our first stay of our wintertrip to Hawai, Tahiti and Samoa. The hotel is wonderfull, very luxury and very good located. The personal over the whole hotel is very kindly and helpfull. The rooms are very beautifull with all comfort and the bathroom is fantastic. Breakfeast buffet give you a very big choice of food and drinks. The diner in the restaurant was also very good, enough and this with a splendid service. What a pitty we only stayed four nights here. But sure is once we come again."
The St. Regis in San Francisco is an exquisite hotel close to the business district. Rooms are bright and nicely decorated. Service is impeccable and it was walking distance to many of my business meetings. Rates can be a bit on the high side during high season otherwise it is a great choice. 
"Service at this hotel is consistently excellent.  The rooms are bright, modern and very comfortable.  Location is close to Union Square and San Francisco Shopping Centre.  A few kms from the downtown financial district.  The pool and spa are a pleasure to visit. The workout facilities are well equipped."
"We had our second stay at the St Regis San Francisco for our annual December SF dining weekend--our first was in 2014, though I've had a few business stays in the meantime. Overall, we still love this hotel--but we did experience a few hiccups with service that gave us pause. The hotel has already provided us with a complimentary stay for 2016 to make up for the problems this year, so we feel the hotel got the message and definitely has taken steps to make it up to us.We were informed of our upgrade from the Astor to Metropolitan Suite in an email from my Ambassador the night before arrival. Yet on arrival, they didn't have us in the Metropolitan Suite. After 25 min and showing the email confirmation, we finally were given the keys to the correct suite. This was a big hiccup, but since we got the upgrade I was willing to let it go.The suite and design of the hotel and and everything about it is still near-perfect for me. I love the design of the property, and the layout of the suites/rooms. I love its location in SoMa. I love the food/beverage, from the restaurant, room service and the lobby bar. Everyone is very friendly.We did have several housekeeping mistakes, and the management response to those was less than satisfactory. Even after our complaints, housekeeping still managed to screw up, something that I'd not experienced on any previous stay at this hotel. The fact that this was the weekend immediately prior to the Christmas holiday made me wonder if the property might be a bit understaffed or under-managed. We also had issues with wifi, both in the room (which was fixed in a few hours) and in the restaurant (which was fixed in about 20 min). We finally had issues with trying to reach our butler(s) on several occasions. We would call and it would ring and ring and ring with no answer on numerous tries. That was also another first for us at this hotel. We often had to call another department to be connected to the butler or front desk, and even then it took more time than it should have. That again made us wonder if the hotel was understaffed due to the imminent holiday period.Otherwise, again, we still love this hotel. Considering that we've had nothing but near-flawless visits here, we were and are most willing to give the hotel the benefit of the doubt. The fact that the hotel management awarded us a free 3 night stay for next December 2016 to remedy the mistakes of this visit more than made up for us for the lack of excellent service in the instances described above. We have faith that these were unusual slip-ups, and I still look forward to returning. I also have several business trips to SF planned in 2016, and I expect to be staying here for those, as well."
"I stayed in St. Regis in mid August for 2 nights. The check in had the usual doorman and other uniformed service greeting. Rooms were spacious for San Francisco standard and of course great location in the SOMA district, walking distance from Union Square. Being served from the champagne cart at check in was a nice touch, but that may be a special occasion and not present all the time? Arriving after 3 PM arrival, we were told that our room with 2 beds was not available. It was a bit frustrating but we were offered a king and a free rollaway bed. We're flexible with our sleeping arrangement but I can see how that may by a huge disappointment for some guests. Some ask why would you pay a premium for a luxury hotel? The answer is for service like that of Benson the bellman. Upon arrival, we had probably over 15 items in our car, ranging from water bottle to reading materials. When Benson arrived to our room, all items were accounted for. I mean everything I needed! Clearly, Benson anticipated the guest's need and worked meticulously in what the general public may perceive as a simple task. In addition, he took great lengths to explain the features of the room. I know this is just one small aspect of a hotel stay, but if you are one to emphasize  details, well here's one for the books."
All staff was great! Room was beautiful. View from our room was gorgeous.  Concierge planned our travel around San Francisco and it was the best.  Everyone made our stay very nice. We will return here in the future!
"Stayed 3 nights for business. Very clean, quiet, and what you expect from St. Regis. The free morning fruits and water was nice as well. Only hiccup was that being a long time SPG gold/platinum member - I requested a room with a view but got a room facing another building directly across. I made the reservation months in advance as well but oh well. Overall, decent stay. "
This hotel is extremely well run and very well cared for.  The staff is outstanding and the service is excellent.  The fitness center is small but well equipped.  This is my favorite hotel in San Francisco.
"My wife and I really wanted to stay at the St. Regis in San Francisco - I even booked a fairly expensive suite, complete with butler service.  Then the email came: the hotel would be undergoing an electrical upgrade the day we were due to check in, and therefore we wouldn't be able to check in until 4pm.  This was especially troubling, as with American Express we should have been able to check in at noon.  I called the hotel to find out what would happen if the upgrade didn't go as planned, as was told, ""well, if you're worried about that, you can stay in one of our other hotels.""  Not very comforting.  I also asked how guests would be compensated, as the hotel was effectively giving me less time in the hotel for the same amount of money.  The response (from two people on two days, apparently reading from the same script): ""we're not offering any discount or concession.  If that's a problem, we can help you find a room in another hotel.""I don't care how nice the hotel is, it can't be 5-star with that kind of service.  It wasn't rude, but it was certainly obnoxious.  How about drinks or a meal to compensate me for effectively being locked out of the hotel until 4pm?  It was extremely odd, especially when you consider that the hotel would be empty during the electrical upgrade.  You'd think that management would be happy to get the hotel filled back up as soon as possible."
The St Regis is not cheap but it is a very nice hotel and couldn't ask for a better location while attending a conference. High end amenities all around and the staff was very accommodating. I will certainly stay next time as well.
"I stayed here for 6 nights for a conference at the convention center.  The reservation for standard room was upgraded to Metropolitan suite.  This is a luxurious hotel with an emphasis on outstanding service which I will detail below.A few days prior to check in the butler service emailed me offering their assistance ahead of time.  I was able to take advantage of this by having them arrange some dinner reservations (I was unsuccessful getting through to the restaurant myself.)  What was most impressive was the rapid response within half an hour of my email.  They also kept some work items for me that I shipped ahead of time and presented them to me on check in.Hotel location is great for the convention center, and you can easily walk to Yerba Buena gardens, the Westfield mall and Union Square.  Unfortunately during my stay the Museum of Modern Art was closed for renovations.  On arrival I was immediately helped by the valet who took care of the luggage and escorted me to the front desk; the valet and one of the front desk staff both offered me some water.  Check in was efficient.  Later on when I asked questions or needed something the front desk went way out of their way to help.  Although sometimes they were busy they always seemed to be able to help me right away, probably because they always seemed to be well staffed.The suite was very clean with all but a bedroom lamp in good working order.  At one point the electronic display used to operate room lights, blinds and call the butler malfunctioned and someone was immediately called to repair it while I was out; when I returned I found a note card from them stating it was repaired and apologizing for any inconvenience.  The suite is very large, nicely decorated, with 3 flat screen televisions (one on bedroom wall, one on living room wall, one in bathroom on one side of the counter with sinks.)  The front door has a door bell for visitors to ring, and an electronic do not disturb button (you also can control this from an electronic screen in the suite's bedroom or living room.) The carpet in the bedroom was very soft. It looked like there was a wood floor in the living room.  I had a nice view from 16th floor.  I was high up so street noise was not too bothersome, but I did hear some noise so soundproofing could be better. ( I find that foam earplugs come in very handy when traveling.)  The bathroom had large counter with two sinks, a separate (very large) tub and shower; shower had option of using hand held shower head or a rainfall shower head.  Water pressure was great, temperature nice and warm.  Everything was spotlessly clean.  Towels thick and soft, and plenty of them including extra large sizes.  Two good quality bathrobes.  Strangely, the bed sheets were substandard compared to everything else - they felt rough.  Also I hated the Remede hair products and liquid soap - the hair products made my hair feel like straw, and the liquid soap had too strong a scent, and small scrubbing beads that I suspect are damaging to the environment. There is a refrigerator in the room with various snacks/drinks for purchase.  The bottled water was free of charge.  Every night I had a fresh bucket of ice on the desk in the living room.I did use the wi-fi and it worked fine.  You have to pay for it unless you are Starwood preferred member.I was most impressed by the outstanding housekeeping.  If I returned to my room later in the AM after a couple of hours the room was already serviced with trash removed, bathroom cleaned, bed made etc.  The nightly turndown service was very refined.  In addition to turning on the Bose radio, a small square sheet was laid on the floor next to the bed with St. Regis slippers placed upon it, and a small silver tray with a glass and a bottle of water on the bedside table.  A small note card informing me of the weather the next day was also placed on the tray.  Some rooms in the hall near mine did have newspapers delivered, but I did not, although I suppose if I had asked they would have done so (I got papers from the fitness center - see below.)The fitness center had plenty of cardio machines including upright and recumbent bikes, treadmills, steppers etc.  I never had to wait for a machine. All equipment was in good working order, with TV screens attached, and a towel and earphones on each machine.   The first time I went to work out a staff person offered me a bottle of water; there was always someone on duty replacing towels, cleaning up etc. They had fresh fruit and water available.  They also stocked various newspapers so after my AM workout I could take a paper to read with breakfast.  The swimming pool was great: water was warm and the couches comfortable, and large windows to let in natural light.  It was a nice length for swimming laps.  I did not visit the spa so cannot comment on that.There is free coffee/tea to go on a cart outside Vitrine restaurant, and the tea is good quality.  Breakfast in Vitrine was good, although pricey.  I did have dinner in Ame and the food there is excellent.They have a Bentley that is available after 6 PM.  I wanted to try it out by dropping off a friend who was staying at another hotel late one evening and then returning to the St Regis, but oddly the valet said their policy was to drop off or pick up, not both.  Oh well.Check out was efficient, and they were able to get a taxi for me quickly.  After I got home I found a couple of erroneous charges for the in-room Honor Bar - they thought I had taken a couple of sodas but in fact I had not consumed anything.  I called the hotel and they said they would remove the charges from my credit card.Overall my stay was excellent, particularly as I had a very large suite for the cheaper standard rate.  What this hotel does best is provide outstanding service that makes you feel like they really care about your comfort and satisfaction.  There is room for improvement (need better bath products, rough bed linens, strange Bentley policy, mistaken charges, need better soundproofing) but the commitment to service and attention to detail make this hotel a cut above the others.  If you can afford it this hotel will provide a luxurious and pampered stay."
"We had a very unpleasant stay at the St Regis. My wife(who is pregnant) and I suffered form various bug bites while staying in the St Regis San Francisco.We stayed at the St Regis San Francisco for our wedding anniversary for 4 nights, at our check in we received a room upgrade and all the staff was very friendly and helpful. Our problems started on the second night when I noticed some bug bites in my arm (arround 8), I told staff form the front desk about the situation before going out to dinner and when we returned they assured us that there was no trace of bug; on the next morning I woke up with even MORE bug bites and my wife had her first bug bites on her(our main concern was her pregnancy).As I did the check out I told the staff about tis new bites and told me they where going to inspect the room one more time. I received an email telling me that there was no trace of bed bugs and that they would give me 5,000 point of their frequent client/guest program.I sent another email to te hotel letting them know of our concern and the answer has always been denying any trace of bed bugs.It is the first time that we are bitten by this short of insects, and it is very frustrating to receive the kind of treatment from St Regis staff when we expressed our concerned treating me a liar or even as someone who is looking to capitalize on a bug bite. As a result of being bitten by bedbugs we had to endure with a derogatory treatment from the staff."
"Our company gifted us a trip to San Fran, and put us up in the St. Regis.  The hotel was beautiful, and in the best location.  My room was gorgeous, with a huge bathtub and shower.  All remote blinds, lights and the most lovely turn down service complete with slippers and a robe.  The convention ballroom and breakfast every morning was incredible.  The complete royal treatment!  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone! "
Stayed in Madison suite 16th floor overlooking San Fran for one night. Room was absolutely beautiful and staff was very courteous and professional except for doorman/valet/guy that just stands at front of hotel with white gloves on....I guess if you show up in a uber it's frowned upon for some reason I haven't quite figured out. Not only did he question if I was staying there he also wouldn't open door for me(I can open my own door just fine the interaction was unprofessional) Room comes with 24 hour butler service(Andre) is not only friendly but extremely helpful and super professional. Excellent choices of food and wine with room service. Indoor pool on 6th floor is very nice. Did not get a chance to eat at 4th floor restaurant. This hotel is a treat and would highly recommend it
"I tagged along with my wife for a conference and the association paid for the hotel. Good thing but I would have freaked out paying $1,000 a night anywhere led alone this place. The room is nice but worth $400 a night tops. I cringe paying over $250 a night to sleep anywhere, hotels are a rip off and this place is way too expensive.Service is very friendly, food is good (over priced) and the room is nice but again, not worth the money.They did provide free wifi and for me, that is huge. Will not come back here based on price."
"I've stayed at the other high-end hotels in this city in the past, but this one takes the cake now in my book. The upper level rooms have fabulous views (esp. If you get a corner). Friendly, non-overbearing service. Tech in my room (executive corner room on 17th floor) included motorized shades and centralized control for lighting / do not disturb control / climate / etc. Downstairs bar was lively with friendly, skilled bartenders.  Everything you would want from a 5-star establishment. Definitely worth the cost."
"Quick stay here, but this was everything a business hotel stay should be and much more.  Like most luxury properties, the service can be a little overbearing, but everything was exceptionally smooth.  The front desk clerk was friendly on checkin and very helpful late in the night for dining advice.  The room I had was amazing.  I think this was the only Starwood hotel I have not stayed at in this market and it is clearly the best.  It is also one of the best hotels that I’ve ever experienced."
"This is the type of place that one reserves the five star rating for. Great rooms, view, service. Every little detail (eg, hand written notes with the weather forecast for the next day) is nicely done. I was at a workshop in the ballroom for a day-- very nice facility."
This hotel by far is the best hotel to stay for couple or business trip.  It's super clean and nice. The staffs are extremely helpful and friendly.  I definitely will stay here again for future business trips!
"While expensive compared to the tourist options, the rooms are exceptionally comfortable and of a nice size for the price. The staff always shows great customer service. Highly recommended for business travelers or families that enjoy upgraded rooms as an alternative to the smaller and lesser-priced tourist stay hotels. "
"I love this hotel. Had a weekend stay. Would highly recommend. They are not a cheap hotel...if you are trying to impress, this is the hotel for you! The entire staff was absolutely awesome. The food was great. Views of the city are great....convenient location in town."
"Very clean, comfortable bed, quality bedding, luxurious towels - can't  ask for more than this hotel offers!  Only negative is that Complimentary wifi is virtually non existent and basic service is $14.95/day!  Room is modern, high tech with Bose.  Location is good - walkable to the Wharf area.  Lobby bar very nice also.  A coffee pot and complimentary newspaper would have been nice!"
We recently stayed at the St. Regis for my mom's 50th birthday and they truly knocked it out of the park. As expected the property was beautiful and the service was incredible. Benson from the bell desk was truly welcoming! Del from IRD was so friendly and helpful. And the spa is a must!!! Easily the best spa in the city! Cherrylin at the spa was a wonderful host and I would recommend Adrienne for an amazing massage! Looking forward to returning to the St. Regis when we come back to visit. 
"We were traveling through the city for a special occasion in Napa and stayed one night at the St Regis. From the moment we checked in the service was exceptional. The front desk acknowledged my SPG status and was able to upgrade us to a Metropolitan Suite. Absolutely beautiful one bedroom suite on the 20th floor. We took advantage of the butler service and had a couple of garments pressed and my size 13's shined.As we were leaving for dinner, the doorman asked us where we were heading and if within 2 miles the house Bentley could take us.... Why Yes, That would be wonderful.....and it was.Check out the next morning was quick and efficient and we where on our way. We would stay at this property in a heartbeat on our next trip to the city.The staff goes out of their way to make your stay perfect."
"Just stayed here for 7 nights with my fiancée on a business trip. This hotel is in a fantastic location for downtown SF and has a really cool vibe in the ground floor lobby and bar area.The paid (rather than free) wireless is fast, and the staff are very attentive. The rooms are well appointed and the restaurant food is above average. We liked the automated drapes with Roman and Black Out blinds in the room. The bathroom is big enough to have both shower room and sizeable bath.I visited the spa for a massage which was very good. My fiancée had a facial which she rated as one of the best she has ever had. Praise indeed..,!  We used the hotels house car ( a very nice Bentley) twice to get to dinner locations. Very nice...!!!So why can't I rate this hotel a '5'?Starting in the bedroom (chortle...), the bed is too hard, the water pressure in the shower/toilet/sink is too low, not enough hanging space for 2 people for a weeks stay, and our cleaner was a bit hit and miss... The lighting and decor in the 4th floor restaurant provides zero ambience - which is a shame because we really enjoyed the food. The lobby bar is very expensive. Five glasses of house pink champs set us back $250!  One time we used room service and asked for 2 small bottles of water and 2 bananas. Very surprised to have to pay $38!Over the years I've tried most of downtown SF hotels, and despite my negative comments, the St Regis remains the best. Yes - I will stay here again!"
Best hotel in town. I had the butler service but that aside the staff are so attend time from the minute you arrive. I normally stay at the W who now look average once you stay at his hotel.  Perfect location not far from the shopping district. The rooms are nice size and modern. I still can't get over how good it is here!
An exceptionally nice hotel.  I stayed at the St Regis for about 10 days in late August 2015.  The view was outstanding.  Service.....outstanding.  Location....outstanding.  You get the point.   I don't think you can go wrong with this choice.
"My wife and I took a long weekend trip to San Francisco to celebrate our 10th anniversary. By random chance it was Fleet Week so everything was full and busy. Even with the crowds and a Democratic National Committee fundraiser in the building, the staff made us feel welcome and special. The breakfast at the restaurant on the 4th(?) floor was impeccable as well."
"St. Regis are consistently luxurious and expensive.  This one is no exception.  Small lobby, but great service, beautiful rooms, great workout facility.  It is a location that's not overly ideal for the touristy options (Wharf, bridge, china town), but if you want class and can afford it, this is the place."
"My husband and I stayed 2 nights at the St Regis San Francisco.   Previously we have stayed at the St. Regis NY and the St. Regis Rome so for us this was a more modern version of the St. Regis.  With that being said, the room was excellent and furnished to a high standard. I liked that they had large windows with a marble seating ledge so you can sit and view the city.  The staff was very helpful and friendly.  It is in a great location for walking to area attractions and is an easy spot to find an Uber.  If you’re going to dinner close by ask to take the house car….it’s a brand new Bentley!"
"Checked in for 4-night stay for a conference at Moscone.  Did not have 2 beds so got a room with king bed.  Room was fine except later realized the lights automatically switched off after a minute and very unpredictable.  Discussed with front desk and turned out the room was a ""model suite"" and had this electrical problem (not realized before?).  Managed to change to a 2-bed accessible room after engineer said no way to fix the electrical problem.  Rest of stay was otherwise pleasant and service was excellent."
This hotel is everything you read about what a 5 star should be. Excellent service with very nice rooms. The morning coffee service was exactly on time. Turn down service was elegant and beds were excellent as were the pillow. The only down side is that I am not a fan of rain drop showers which they have nor do I like the opaque glass enclosed toilets. Everything in the bathroom echoes and doors make loud crashing sound. I dropped a plastic brush and it loud. Other than that an excellent property. 
"This hotel was first class in every way.  The rooms as well as the common areas are beautiful and the service was second to none.  Without a doubt, this is my new ""go to"" in SanFrancisco.  I enjoyed both the modern look of the rooms and the central location of the hotel."
"Stayed here for three nights. Didn't receive any room upgrade which I was entitled to however the hotel was busy therefore this understandable.Check in was faultless and staff were very attentive and friendly. The room was excellent and furnished to a very high standard. One minor point is the evening turndown service wasn't consistent. I only received this once during my stay meaning I had to call the butler service to deliver ice, however the were very quick to respond. Wifi here is excellent, very fast and kept a constant connection.Food service in the hotel is excellent. Vitrine restaurant for breakfast is a la carte only and no buffet, however they do have an excellent choice and good quality food, if a little pricey.  Ame restaurant was outstanding food wise. For a Michelin star restaurant the prices I thought were very good however do make a reservation as the first night Ame was fully booked and I couldn't eat there. Pool looked very nice, however the times I went it was full of rowdy children so couldn't enjoy it. The spa has a fee of USD20 to use its facilities if you are not receiving a treatment. It does have a good range of treatments which are not surprisingly on the expensive side.Location wise the hotel is in a good part of the city with shops and restaurants very close by. Would stay here again if I needed to be in San Fran downtown."
"We arrived at the St. Regis on 7/7/15 and stayed for 3 evenings as part of our vacation.  The hotel is luxurious, very modern, and in a great area of San Francisco. Our was upgraded thru our travel agent upon arrival and we stayed in 1608.  This is large corner suite with dining and living rooms.  The bathroom and bedroom were huge.  All the lights, window treatments, and electronics are operated thru several controllers located in many areas of the suite.  We had butler service.  My girlfriend said the spa was very good.  We breakfast in our room each morning and it was a great way to begin the day.  I have been to San Francisco many times on vacation and for business and I believe this has to one of the best hotels in the city.  It is a little pricey, but I think it is a good value."
"We travel to SF once a year, and we used to stay all different places.  No more. Always, forever more, it will be the St. Regis.  First, the service is impeccable. The location is perfect for us and everything is easy to get to from here, even down to Fisherman's wharf. The bar is beautiful! Everything is top-notch. "
The St Regis did not disappoint in any way. The rooms are modern but very luxurious with amazing city views.  The service at all points was flawless.  The bar is busy but the service is still well done.  It's right next to the MOMA and a short walk to much of San Francisco's main attractions.  Probably the best of SF's high end hotels.   
"Hotel Room #1812$800 per nightHotel room was exactly as I had hoped for. Clean & modern.  Although it is a 10 minute walk from the center and costed $800 per night, it was still worth it.  Every time I left my room, someone had come in to make the room.  I loved the open floor plan.  The bathroom was immaculate and I thoroughly enjoyed the indoor pool on the 6th floor.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and definitely would love to stay here again.  Hotel: 5Staff: 5Amenities: 5I was a little shocked that WiFi was not included."
"This hotel is definitely 5 worthy of its 5 star rating, although the bad and the ugly dimishes my rating to 3 stars.The good:  Most of the staff is friendly, courteous and anxious to please.  The rooms are well appointed and confortable.  The location is perfect, short walks to At&T park, the financial district and the water front.The bad: although the staff is great, management practices seem to hamper their efforts.  While waiting to check in, I was unaware that one side of the check-in lobby was concierge services the other the check-in as there is no signage  .  Wait time exceed 10 minutes to check-in while the concierge side was occupied by 2 staff members not serving anyone.  Seems to me they should have been allowed to step in and speed up the check-in process.  Good thing it wasn't really busy or it could have taken hours.The housekeeping staff was incredible, lots of attention to detail.  Perhaps there was a scheduling issue, when I got back to my room at 4:30 hoping to relax and freshen up for a night out, the room wasn't made up.The ugly: best to get the breakfast included special when offered unless you want to spend $50 per person for breakfast.The hotel has private full time residents and they rule the roost here.  Tried to mistakenly walk through an entrance which which would have brought me to the hotel elevators and was stopped from doing so by the doorman.  Interesting that the door 20 feet down put you in a connected hallway, guess I didn't realize there was that invisible line seperating the hotel riff raff from the pretentious full time residents, almost like a 2 gate system.  In the bar, a woman, presumably a resident, came in with her accessory dog,  staff said nothing even though food services was available in the bar.  If I see that again, a call will be made  to city health department.Overall not a repeat for me, much better places to stay in SF for the money."
"San Francisco is densely populated with hotels yet none are of true 5-star status. We used to love the Ritz-Carlton club level but since the recent refurbishment, the product is uncomfortable, the furniture uncomfortable, the ethos uncomfortable, etc. The Mandarin Oriental used to be sterling but no more. So last night we tried the St. Regis and, whilst it's not quite 5-star yet, I have hopes for it.In the city for opera, arrived at 3:45pm suite not ready but comped a round of drinks in the pleasant lobby-cum-bar. Got into the room around 4:30pm. Small one-bedroom corner suite on the 15th floor. Nice desk set-up, living room tiny but comfortable. Bathroom on the small side but separate shower and tub. Bedroom very decent size. Bed and linens wonderful. Noisy Saturday night with traffic sounds and sirens, even on the 15th floor. All quiet Sunday morning. Next time I'll request a higher floor. Oddly for a hotel of this quality, we could hear our upstairs overlords clomping around and dropping things. Hmmm. Great windows, views good.Room service swift, courteous and pretty good food.Service is where the St. Regis shines, so fine.  We'll return next time we have a city date."
"I will start this review as I start all of my reviews. I stay at over 100 hotels annually and have stayed at well over 1,000 hotels in total. Everything from high end boutiques to mid range brands.I have a good feel for what a hotel should be. This hotel is everything you want when staying in San Francisco. It's in a great area, and this hotel is amazing. The rooms were great, comfortable and clean. Great views and the service is impeccable. I was treated so well while staying here multiple nights. Bellman, Maid Service, Front Desk, Bar Tender and even the maintenance staff. Well done!I had food service multiple nights and the good was great. That is rare with hotels these days. My only negative comment is the walls are very thin. I could hear everything in the hallways and room next door. The TV, people coughing or sneezing, even in the bathroom. That was very unfortunate. If the hotel didn't hit all the other marks so high, I would have been frustrated, but I overlooked this because the rest of the hotel was so epic. Do not hesitate in staying here!"
The St. Regis is my Go to hotel choice when traveling and the one in San Francisco is a great hotel with great value. It's right downtown with friendly staff and great atmosphere. I will continue to stay here whenever i'm back in San Fran.
"Very classy hotel. Great location, beautiful rooms and extraordinary service. We had left a small make- up bag at the airport and the concierge immediately called the airline and located the bag and then sent someone to pick it up! We were here to celebrate a family Bar Mitzvah in Mill Valley and the concierge was helpful in every way possible - from hairdresser to Uber."
"My husband and I stayed at the St. Regis for six nights while visiting San Francisco.  I  spent a great deal of time selecting the hotel for this trip.  After researching and considering many hotels, I chose the St. Regis.  I was very happy with my choice.  The location was great - it was close enough to every place we wanted to visit, without being in the middle of too much of the ""touristy crowd.""    Although our room didn't have the floor to ceiling windows I was expecting, it was nicely equipped and well maintained. I can overlook my disappointment over the absence of a panoramic view because of the amazing service.  From the time we made our reservations to the time we left the hotel, the service was attentive and thoughtful, without being obtrusive.  The concierge and guest relations people helped us with our wine tour, ferry and restaurant plans.    The people at the front desk and in the lobby greeted us by name.   Those at the restaurant, the Vitrine, were particularly kind and thoughtful.  Kane was our server on most mornings.  When he found out it was my birthday, he brought me a special ""breakfast dessert"".   To celebrate our anniversary, he brought us champagne and chocolate.   The service made it  truly a  memorable stay.  I'm sure that the service at the St. Regis will become the standard by which we will measure other hotels."
"Hotels are designed to provide service when you need it. Otherwise they should leave you alone. The staff was top notch, professional and ready to help if you requested it. The room was well appointed, plenty of amenities of a useful nature.Furnishings were of quality and not overbearing with ornate designs.Great location for business or pleasure.Would gladly stay here again.Did not use the gym or restaurant so no comment on them.A 4 star hotel to be sure"
"Genuine and warm service. Amazing representation of California hospitality. The food at Ame was great. Bartender a little grumpy. The staff at front desk was friendly and helpful. Location great, close to everything. Can be hard to get picked up by uber when the traffic is so bad during rush hour. "
"We booked one night here to see the Billy Joel concert at A&T Park and was pleased with the choice. While we booked mostly for the location, the St. Regis named carried some weight. While I don't know that this is truly a 5 star property or the best St. Regis I've stayed at, it was certainly nice. The standard room was good sized and comfortable, with all the accouterments you'd expect (nice robe, slippers, decent toiletries). Room was relatively clean though not spotless, which I would expect for a 5-star hotel. However, we enjoyed it nonetheless.Had a chance to use the fitness center, which was well-equipped and maintained, as well as the indoor lap pool, which was clean and kept at a nice lukewarm temperature (perhaps too warm). I would stay again if coming to that specific area of the city or to see an event at the ballpark.Oh - and if you want a great breakfast in a place with a cool vibe, walk around the corner to Market Street and hit up the Grove, next to Peet's Coffee."
"What a Shock ?  What a Disappointment?  Unbelievable this property and its management are associated with the St Regis brand ?The check in with May was very cold and challenging.  She began dictating to us the Starwood rules regardless of us being Starwood Platinum 100 nites.   This was not the St Regis warm welcome guests normally receive and very much expected.   We were horrified, the room allocated for us was dirty, smelly with a man or men's body odour just terrible.   Quite a larger room and there were white stains on the table it was not cleaned properly or perhaps overlooked entirely.   We doubt the room was checked by a butler or any housekeeping manager before releasing it to a Platinum guests.  Hair strings in bath, the handbasin is blocked, the towels were soiled and many with raggy strings. Utterly beyond belief, Disgusting at St Regis San Francisco !!    The St Regis distinguished itself with its Butler exceptional services.  But at this St Regis Butler's duties are non existent. As well, the housekeeping managers had not checked our room and the bathroom conditions before releasing it.  It is obvious that there is a great lack of communication among butler, housekeeping and the front office departments of this hotel.  When we reached out to management, we received nonplussed responses.   In fact we found that the top management hides behind closed doors and decided not to come out to solve the problems.  This is a great illusion of Grandeur, the SF St Regis there is no substance.  A luxury hotel requires hard work, dedication, and passion.   We are very disappointed!  How can a St Regis offer a guest a dirty and unprepared room?   Who is the GM managing this property?   Obviously this property is deceiving its guests by buying Fake status and claiming its as a 5 stars on Forbes and JustLuxe.   Most Certainly it is not 5 stars.   Forbes should rethink its values and accreditations.Our breakfast appeared to be in a makeshift conference room.  Ok, but waiting over 45 minutes for ""anything"" was a very poor sign.  And then the order of eggs was not done properly, the eggs Benedict was served on completely soggy bread, falling apart.    Simply not up to par.   Starwood needs to take a serious look at this property and also the scoring of it to a category 7.   We have stayed at other St Regis and Starwood hotels and the St Regis is supposed to be the best, highest category;  but this one is not even half way there.   Surely this property has not been checked by Starwood or their mystery guest, otherwise it impossible to be category 7 in Starwood.    It is unbelievable that we encountered these issues at St Regis San Francisco.   Surely no Privileges for Platinum 100 or any guest at this property and most certainly would not return there with current management faking their way through."
"5 years ago it was a much better option ,they still charge high prices and have not İnvested much .Definetely need refurbishment and / or they should be charging much lower .Attitude of reception is unacceptable , some of the consierge is OK , other services ( vale - breakfast... ) is not in accordence with 5 star hotel !!!"
"We spent one night here. St Regis  is very luxury, good location close to financial district. Rooms are very comfortable, bath rooms very luxury, service is very friendly. Try to get a room at 11th floor or higher and you will have a great view on San Francisco. Minus: spa treatment us incredible expensive. "
"Checked in (1 night, still in house as of this review time).  Check in staff was friendly, was promptly checked in and on the way to room.Then it starts to go downhill for a hotel of this price and class rating.  One of the two complimentary bottles of water in the room was already open (the 'click' mechanism didn't unclick when opened).  One of the face towels had a hair on it.  The robes were tattered and had holes.  One of the two bathroom lights weren't working properly.  The bathroom sink didn't drain.  The shower had hair all over it.  I called down to ask for the shower to be cleaned again.  The staff was apologetic and said they'd send someone up immediately.  over an hour later, someone came up.  I figured it'd be cleaned up.  When I got into the shower, the hair was still there, just moved around.  Minor, but still just surprising for a hotel of this class rating: turn down service was odd.  No happy little chocolates on the pillows, no closing of the blinds.  Not sure what was happening.Then, after a long day, I turn on the TV.  The TV didn't work properly.  Trying to use the up and down channel buttons causes an annoying clicking sound.Just annoying for any guest who has a long day and is just trying to enjoy a nice relaxing evening."
"My PA tried to book this hotel via the hotels PR company. The stay would have been used for a review of The Hotels Of The World section of our Dubai website. We were originally quoted media rates (I hold a fully accredited international press card) but with then messed around with room type requests and told some days were not available despite these days been available on their website, we even contact them an offer to pay the full rate for that night but within ignored when we called them direct and emailed, we even had promises of contact on Facebook which again never happened. If this is the level of service they offer before we have paid, I dread to think what it will be like once in residence. Incredibly disappointing for such a prestigious brand."
"This is truly a luxury hotel in a great location, within walking distance to museums and restaurants.  The rooms were fabulous, and the service excellent.  Could not ask for anything more.  Do make sure to book through spg if you're a member.  Parking with the hotel can be expensive, but that's to be expected."
"This hotel is a very good hotel located particularly well not far from Union Square and ticks most of the boxes.Our room was fantastic! In fact I think it was one of the best designed hotel rooms I have ever stayed in anywhere. Everything just seemed to be in the right place and was the right size. Congratulations to the design team. The only thing the designers missed were the size of the white bathroom towels. They were too small. Normally the towels are a real treat but for some reason not so at the St Regis!Check in was easy and the concierge team were brilliant. However, when it came to breakfast I must say unfortunately I was totally underwhelmed!!! From the waiter who appeared bored and wanted to be at home to the actual breakfast which was very expensive, sounded interestingly but failed to deliver the experience. As this is such a good hotel I was very surprised that breakfast did not deliver the quality but above all the expectation.I will stay at the St Regis again as it is a very good hotel but I plan to eat out for breakfast which is a great pity."
"Starwood members but first time @ a St. Regis hotel.  Very nice property! We were in a suite that was beyond spacious and had amazing views of the city and water. The bedroom and bathroom were spotlessly clean, bed super comfortable, 3 tvs (1 in the bathroom!).  Room service was also excellent.  We were looking to relax and this hotel allowed just that for us.  Location is also great for business, restaurants, and shopping.  New fans of St. Regis and can't wait to visit another."
"Stayed here on business and was able to afford it only because all other hotels were sold out and my company had no other choice - I wish I Had a room like this at home - Beautifully appointed and decorated, modern, attractive, upscale - If you can, yes stay there!"
This is my third time staying at the property and my favourite to date.  Spent four nights in an Astor suite and enjoyed every minute.  Service was excellent and the room quite lovely.  Extremely comfortable beds and awesome Remede toiletries.  Reception and concierge attentive and helpful.  Champagne and lemonade available for guests in the lobby on Fridays and Saturdays - a nice touch!  Enjoyed every minute and will be sad to leave.
"This was my favorite hotel I have ever stayed at.  The staff was so well trained, friendly, and able to help me with all of my requests.  I think if you are coming to visit San Francisco and can afford this gem, then definitely stay.  Hopefully I will have a chance to come back to this wonderful city and stay at this excellent hotel!"
"Hotel has nice rooms with modern technology. IT is 10 minutes walk Union Square.But the hotel is very expensive. Not only the room rates but also the minibar, services and the hotelbar.IT is not worth the money."
"We always stay at the St. Regis and it is always beautiful.  The room is beautifully appointed and the bar is lovely too!  We take Uber to get to other parts of the city, but if you like to walk you can get to plenty of restaurants and shops."
We stayed in two adjoining rooms at the hotel.  It was a low floor and the noise from garbage trucks and the event space were hectic.  So one call and the manager upgraded us to a suite on a high floor.  Cookies and milk were delivered for the kids.  Staff were absolutely awesome in all respects.  We will be back!
"Positives:Excellent staff who are all very well trained. First class.We had an issue with a lost reservation and they addressed it very competently and upgraded us to a lovely suite.Negatives:The standard room (we were upgraded after the first night) was OK but nothing special, the bathroom felt a bit grubby, and small things like lights / TV remote batteries weren't working.I am allergic to dust mites so I am like a beacon for well cleaned rooms. On the second day I had a bad allergy attack that lasted until I was 12-24 hours gone from the St Regis. I would wake up in my hotel bed with an itchy throat and itchy eyes that would get better as the day was spent out of the hotel.  it's hard to really criticise the hotel for this, but it is indicative of the housekeeping standards.The restaurant - it felt like a converted office floor. Not up to the visual standards of a top class hotel, although the food (breakfast) was fine.The hotel was cold...crazy air con in the lobby and gym, even for a US hotel.Overall - not a bad hotel but as somewhere that wants to be the best in the city I felt it came up somewhat short of the ""spectacular"" I'd expect to come with such an accolade."
"We stayed two nights on a weekend trip from LA --- we have stayed at a ton of properties and several St. Regis properties before.  This felt like a Westin to me, nothing more.  We spent @1500 for two nights, even with an AMEX Platinum upgrade the room wasn't that impressive.  Yes, it was a good sized room for SF and the beds are comfy but overall it was bland and a bit dated.  Service was friendly, but nothing stood out -- best service we had was at the bar. Indoor pool was nice, open all night, but no hot tub... We are returning to SF in a few weeks again and will not be returning to the St. Regis.  Tripadvisor reviews failed me this time :)"
"We usually stay at the W Hotel (located virtually next door), but our last few times there, the place seemed a little tired and overly packed with annoying people in the bar. We checked out the St. Regis and got a suite.  To say we were not disappointed is a massive understatement.  It was one of the most wonderful hotels we've ever stayed at (rivaling but not surpassing Shanghai).  The staff was exceptional.  The design of the lobby bar beautiful and sleek.  Our suite was a corner room, perfectly designed for privacy.  The view was exceptional, looking out on the beautiful skyline which was magically romantic at night and breathtaking during the day.  Floor to ceiling windows took advantage of all the beauty the city has to offer.  The higher floors are just amazing. Of special note -- the room service.  Expensive, sure.  But that's to be expected.  But the food was outstanding.  We were in town for a rather somber event, so we actually weren't in the mindset to go out and take advantage of the top notch restaurants a foodie town like SF has to offer.  But we were lucky that the food provided at the hotel was amazing. A lobster bisque to die for (""I mentioned the bisque"").  The bar had a steak sandwich that makes my mouth water just thinking of it.  An outstanding grilled salmon.  The cookies were surprisingly weak (with the odd choice of adding fruit to the chocolate chip cookies).  But it was the one small misstep in an otherwise fantastic set of meals.  We have found a new favorite place to stay.  We will be up again in October and undoubtably for New Years as well.  Thank you St. Regis... You did us right."
"The property, room and staff were great. The staff really did an amazing job and were consistently courteous and welcoming . The room was great - a nice blend of comfort and amenities. I can't wait to return."
"Recently stayed at the St. Regis at the beginning of July. Our stay at the hotel was amazing and it was made even better by the friendly staff. The concierge, Eric, was extremely helpful in recommendations of where to eat and also what wineries to visit. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting San Francisco."
"I´ve stayed twice at this magnificent hotel one last year during May and another in February this year, both stays were excellent , but I mainly want to talk about a very Special person that used to work at this hotel and now she has been promoted to the St Regis New York , and She is Daniela Cataldo , she took care of my brother in Law that had 2 surgery procedures in san Francisco more than an hotel Manager , I felt that she was taking care of the family more like a very special nurse. and not only when he was staying at the hotel but even long after he left the hotel she was still asking How was he doing, I think that if all the hotels have person Like Daniela , the hotel industry will improve a lot , but It was not only daniela all the Hotel Staff Were excellent in attending all the family , I wrote all this words , but I can resume with only ¨Thank You ¨"
"This hotel is on the more modern side so you'll need to like that kind of look and feel to really rate it top notch.  I thought it was great.  My daughter ran in the SF marathon and the location was perfect for that, Union Square, shopping, a little business I did beforehand, etc.  Had one little negative with the car valet but otherwise flawless."
This hotel was fantastic from the minute we arrived until our departure.The staff were all excellent professional and very accommodating.The room was spotless and beds were uber comfy.Communal area of hotel including bar was excellent. Staff second to none. Only slight complaint would be lack of coffee/tea facilities on the room and perhaps some complimentary soft drinks for kids as per Langham Hotel in NYC which we have stayed in and has a similar vibe. All in all very very good! 
We booked two rooms for a family of 4. The rooms were perfectly decorated! I loved how you could automatically close the blinds. The views were amazing in both rooms. Beds were to die for. (Extremely comfortable). Service was on point. I can't find even one thing to complain about! We only had breakfast once but we loved it. The lobby was also a masterpiece. Loved it! Nothing else to say. :)Stayed in early July 2015.
"I stayed one night and it was lovely.  The rooms are big and the bed is very comfortable with high-quality bedding.  The only strange thing that happened is that a room attendant came into the room while I was there,  which startled both of us.  He wasn't expecting to see me and I certainly wasn't expecting to see him!  I had checked in about 40 minutes earlier so I don't know what the confusion was.  Thankfully, I was dressed and just working on my laptop."
"The San Francisco St. Regis is a great US city hotel... so why not a five star review?  Well, while the service was exceptional... a butler assigned to  pack and unpack you, and the facility modern, and comfortable, we stayed in a suite on the 11th floor... very spacious, there is just not that something extra.  It was missing that ""intangible"" feeling that you get inside when you stay at one of the ""it"" places.   No WOW! that would throw this hotel into the ""amazing"", though Im not sure there would have been anything the St. Regis staff could have done better.  In fact, while I write this review, my wife reminds me of the great food, wonderful location and amazing shower pressure. However,  when you travel around the world and stay in extraordinary hotels, you become spoiled.  The hotel had no spectacular architecture and no amazing art work to speak of.  In short, nothing unique to make you remember this particular great city hotel. If I return to this beautiful city, this WOULD be the place i'd stay .... I'd probably just not recall why."
"This is a sleek, slick, modern property with beautifully appointed rooms, neutral colours and natural stones, and all the mod cons. Room service was excellent, but we found the breakfast pricy and underwhelming (not surprising for a five star hotel though). No complaints. "
"The hotel is in a great location.  The staff was amazing.  The room was quiet and very nice.  Surprised it was so nice.  I am writing more words because they want the review to be 200 characters, but I think my review was long enough."
"Very nice hotel with high standard and very similar to the other St Regis. Room are large, nice and clean, everybody is extremely friendly, We went to visit the Four Season nearby where we had breakfast and not a single regret to have chosen the st regis.Just one negative small point : breakfast without a buffet and only a la carte"
We stayed at the St Regis San Francisco and it was beautiful!  The rooms are very nice and clean. the staff is very accommodating and helpful.  They have big windows with a marble seating ledge so you can sit and view the city. It was beautiful at nite with all the lights of the city!!   We brought our two toy poodles and they were very welcomed by the staff. The hotel is in walking distance to stores and restaurants downtown and they have a driver at the hotel if you need a ride anywhere in the city!    I would definitely stay at St Regis again while in San Francisco.
"I can't say enough good things about this hotel. It was my second time staying here and it was yet another fabulous stay. I'm an AMEX platinum card member and Starwood Gold so I have gotten room upgrades each time. First time, we were upgraded to an Astor Suite, which was just lovely. This trip, all the suites were sold out due to a conference but we were given a room on the highest floor with garden view. The view was amazing!! Especially at night. All amenities are top notch, great indoor pool. Breakfast every morning was delicious. The goody bags for kids are very thoughtful and fun. This is definitely my ""go to"" hotel when I'm in San Fran."
We had a Fantastic time staying in this Historic Hotel. The staff is friendly and very helpful. The Restaurant and Bar is just outstanding and a lot of fun. Great Atmosphere. The location is on the trolley line and easy in and out.
"The staff and management here are at the top of their game, this is a very well run hotel.  Smooth check in, friendly staff, amazing welcome pack for the kids, lovely rooms.  Pool is a good size.  Breakfast offering is very good quality.  Nice touch with the breakfast amuse bouche.   Excellent housekeeping, room was impeccable and serviced twice daily.  Great location - very close to Market St and Union Square and all the shopping, BART station around the corner.Any negatives? Small closets, slow/patchy Wi-Fi.  Also I ordered an espresso at Vitrine - $10 for a coffee! Slightly ridiculous."
"Just stayed again at the St Regis San Francisco and I have nothing but good things to say about the hotel, lobby, service and rooms! You really get the extra you are paying for. Certainly a no 1 pick when in San Francisco."
"I've long been a fan of this hotel but tended to prefer the Four Seasons for superior service, even though the rooms are a bit dated.  But after a handful of recent stays, I'm convinced that service is at least on par with the FS, and the rooms are superior."
"Work sponsored a night here and the St. Regis never fails to impress. It's probably triple the size of most hotel rooms in the downtown area and everything is so luxurious. The room is full automated from a console near the nightstand (lights, curtains - blackout ones included, music, TV, etc). There's both a walk in shower and bath tub and a huge sink area. Great treat for yourself if you've got the money for it."
"We loved the time spent at the St Regis!  My husband was here on business and I joined him.   We experienced superior service and immaculate surroundings.  The rooms were contemporary and well maintained.  The staff was friendly and helpful, consistently greeting us as we arrived and departed.  It was a 10 minute walk to the water and in the area of several restaurants.  The bar had a nice, professional crowd.  The business meals were tasty and well prepared. The elevator service was prompt for a large hotel."
"This is a great spot in SF.  Walkable to Union Square/Chinatown, and a short ride to many other sites.  Hotel is beautiful.  Great lobby and lobby bar, service is excellent.  Everyone is SO friendly and helpful and polite.  They must have an amazing training program because everyone we encountered was fantastic.  Room was spacious and well appointed.  Great bathroom--very large, separate toilet room. Nice towels, very comfortable beds.  Highly recommend."
"We stayed here while our older son was at a swim camp in the area.  This was our first time staying at a St. Regis hotel and I can say I am really impressed with the service!  We  stayed in the Astor suite, beautiful views and a very spacious suite but what really impressed us was the service.  Everyone was extremely polite and helpful, they came in every evening and setup my son's bed.  One evening one of their staff even noticed I was bringing a bottle of champagne on the elevator and asked if I wanted ice.  She then showed up not 10 minutes later with a bucket of ice and champagne flutes.It is the nice little included touches like fresh delivered coffee in the morning and hot chocolate for our son that make a stay memorable.  "
"Stayed here three nights. Hotel does everything right.  Room, food, service, bar, attitude and a great location in a great city.  This thing is runs almost like a Ritz and stacks up very well. Worth the money."
"We stayed here two nights, then left for a few outside the city and came back for two more nights. We love the big windows in the rooms with ample space to curl up on the sill and read a book and look out at the amazing views. The room was very comfortable for our family, which included two teens. The customer service is incredible, with it being the only hotel on our week in California that contacted us to help set up activities, make reservations, and attempt to meet all our needs in advance. The gym is fantastic with great city views, and I liked the location in SOMA which was easy walking distance to the Union Square shopping, and the Embarcadero (our fave restaurant, The Slanted Door)."
"This was our first stay at the St Regis San Francisco. We traveled with our 7 year old daughter who was treated like a princess our entire stay. We had a beautiful corner suite on the 17th floor with breath-taking views of the city. From the moment we checked in the staff were exceedingly welcoming. Our daughter had her own little bed that was turned down each evening with a special note from the Butler about the history of the city. What a pleasant touch. She loved our Butler ""Emma"" and enjoyed practicing French with her. What an amazing time we had in a beautiful city. Thank you for a memorable trip. We hope to visit soon!"
"I traveled to SF in May and stayed in an Astor suite.  The room was spacious, modern and comfortable.  Service was top notch in all parts of the hotel from the front desk, to the restaurant and butler service.  When we arrived our room wasn't ready, so the front desk allowed us to get ready at the spa so we could head out on the town for a bit.  I would definitely stay here again on my next trip to SF."
Could have been a little larger and cleaner for what you pay for it but this is San Francisco...  Personally I prefer the fairmont to the St. Regis.  I really had higher hopes.  The bar and car service were excellent as was the service at the spa.
"Definitely a top echelon hotel, with impeccable service. In my view, however, it has some ""slight but rough"" details that may be a throw back. ie very limited closet space; no real place for in-room bag storage, drapes do not close perfectly, etc. While this may sound like being picky or too demanding, those are the standards to be expected from a St Regis.Very good location downtown, right across the street from Yerbabuena Gardens and shopping. Excellent bar. Poor and expensive breakfast option (a $35 credit was not enough to cover Continental Breakfast)."
"Location is slightly off the main grid but hotel is extremely well furnished and upkept. The bed was heaven to sleep in. Had drinks at the bar and although it was not happy hour yet, the server gladly offered us the happy hour promotion. Will definitely stay here again."
I stayed at the hotel with my wife and two kids. The St Regis is a very nice hotel with a friendly staff.  You can expect a very nice stay but it isn't anything overwhelming.  The location is great and almost central to everything.  Our kids were made to feel special upon arrival with a gift package which they loved.  The pool is indoors and nice (no jacuzzi). I always factor in cost value with the rating hence the very good versus excellent rating.
"Well, this is it! you're dreaming of a beautiful hotel, stylish, modern, classy, with perfectly decorated rooms, and in the heart of San Francisco! But you'd also like a beautiful swimming pool at the 6th floor, where you could swim all year? St Regis is the answer. A real 5 star experience where all standards will be met. I had the chance to spend 3 nights there, and no discussion where I'll go next time I'm in SF. Bravo!"
This is a wonderful hotel with impeccable service in every aspect from the doorman to the front desk to the server in the lobby bar to house keeping. Everyone called me by name which was very impressive. Everyone was friendly and attentive. The rooms were well appointed spacious and very clean. The had proper sized towels not the small ones which is one of my barometers of a good hotel. The bed was comfy and the pillows flat and soft just the way I like them. There was a shower and a tub which is also notice. The rain shower was lovely. The only criticism was the TV did not turn to face the bed and channels were slow to load. I would most definitely stay here again. Great job thank you. 
"Stayed here for 5 nights.  It’s centrally located within a 5-10 minute walk from top notch shopping, the famed cable car, BART station & wide selection of dining & most importantly, 3 Starbucks outlets within a 3-block radius.The gym is reasonably well equipped with fruits & drinking water for your hard workout.Daily valet only parking at US$54 was steep but hey, you are in downtown San Francisco.  I expected a 5 star service & experience & that’s what I got."
"Traveling so much I realised one thing. Stars are details of hotel. Details of the willingness to make your staying more comfortable. And if it is real five stars, it means the comfort for all your five senses. Great hotel in the centre of San Francisco with five min walk to msin museums, shops, bars and clubs, and even to famous tram stop. This is one more prove of being St Regis a high end hotel - luxury interior, exterior and location.So if you read this you know where to stay in San Francisco :)"
"Had to stay here for business,  I brought my family and we were treated like royalty.  Staff was nice, friendly and very helpful. Decent location near shopping,  transportation and parks. Facility was clean and spotless. It would be hard to overstate how much we enjoyed our stay and I would recommend to anyone. "
"St. Regis is very well located close enough to Union square and the quality of the hotel is superb, specially the rooms. The room was big, very comfortable and extremely practical with everything you would need for a great stay, either if you are relaxing on or business.Reception was quick and effective but the concierge service was the best, always very attentive. I organized for a package to be received and also a car rental by mail before arriving  and they did both things excellent.The pool was OK, I would not say it was great but it was functional, quite long so that if you want to do a few morning laps then it is OK.I would say the main negative was probably breakfast and breakfast cafe room, it seem a bit tight the breakfast area and breakfast is fully a la carte, so it actually took a bit longer than expected before we had any food in the table. Quality of the breakfast was excellent though."
"We loved the St. Regis Hotel. The rooms are lovely; clean, nice bathrooms, excellent views. This hotel is located around many museums. The concierge was great, free tickets to museums and info on where to go and how to get there. This hotel is a top pick for San Francisco. "
"Stayed here thinking it would be like the Four Seasons or The Ritz Carlton, but it wasn't. don't get me wrong, there was nothing bad, just nothing great. Nice room, nice bathroom, comfy bed, just no wow factor. That's all."
"This is my favorite hotel.  I love this hotel for so many reasons. The rooms are beautiful. The staff remembers me, and always seems genuinely happy to see me again. The spa staff is amazing. Location is ideal."
"Some of the best room service ever especially their breakfast although I once ordered a double espresso by itself and with all the charges was $22. And we were surprised by the stains on the furniture and general run down condition of our suite. Great location, helpful staff and the gym met our needs. "
"My husband and I have stayed at the St Regis as a married couple with no children and as a married couple with smaller children.  We came back to the St.Regis with our entire family as a result of an article which highlighted ""Children Friendly Places to Stay in SF"".  When making the reservation over the phone, the attendant asked our children's names and ages (which we happily provided, assuming this would result in special attention or amenity upon check in, which the children love).  Not only was no special attention or amenity provided (so a little puzzled as to why they asked us for this information), the entire stay we were greeted by the older female concierge with a stink eye, as well as several bellman who appeared annoyed every time we entered and exited the hotel with our stroller. Not one smile or acknowledgement, and moreover, we were made to feel like we shouldn't be there because we had our children with us?  I would also say that the article we relied on was partly ""delusional"" as usually I would assume at least one ""family friendly"" restaurant on site at a 'great hotel to stay at with children'.  We like to travel to finer hotels worldwide, even with our kids in tow, and there are several fine hotels that do gladly accommodate.  The reason I am not providing the hotel with a lower rating, is due to the fact that the hotel is a nice hotel (it is a St Regis), nice location, and a great place to stay WITHOUT kids.  One positive about this particular trip was the room service (and we had a lot of that with the kids) was always extremely professional, and each server that came to the room was delighted to see and help set up the meals for the children.  Additionally the proximity to the Yerba Buena Gardens with the bowling alley and the Childrens Creativity Museum was ideal for this particular trip.  It's a toss up on if we will ever be back with the children."
"I guess if you are an ambassador or senior executive, then my review won't change your outlook on this place, but I was disappointed with my experience. In the interests of full disclosure, I did not stay here, but my employees did, and I paid the bill in person, so I feel it is reasonable to review my experience.We had booked an additional bed in a twin room and when I went to cover the check in, I was told this would not be possible (fire regulations). I can accept the fire regulations, but there was no attempt to resolve the problem beyond telling me I could upgrade to a Suite at an additional fee.I was made to feel it was my fault for booking through a booking site, not with the hotel directly, as this was why the hotel couldn't tell me when I booked that the extra bed wasn't an option.All the usual expensive hotel things are there (although my team told me the food left a lot to be desired), but I was surprised that they were asked to pay extra for WiFi internet connection in their room (at this room price it should be free) and that the front desk were so indifferent and unapologetic with the booking."
"I love this hotel.  I try to stay at the St. Regis whenever I'm in town and this has been my hotel of choice for several years now.  I stayed here for a few nights over the weekend on a business trip recently.  I also brought along several work colleagues and VIP clients so we booked several rooms.  We were nicely looked after by the management team prior and during our arrival.  Loved my stay and my colleagues / clients also loved their experience. In my earlier trips to SF this year, I stayed at the Park Central (horrible) and Four Seasons (just okay) because St. Regis was sold out.  So when I was able to get back into the St. Regis, it reaffirmed why I love this hotel.Location is fantastic.  Walking distance to many conveniences.  Even just how the hotel driveway is nicely tucked into the side street makes it easy to get into the sprinter van, or hail a taxi, etc.  It is convenient, but quiet.  Staying at the W Hotel next door, for example, is quite noisy (partially because of their own club downstairs).Room is gorgeous.  I was in a high floor 1 bedroom suite which was beautifully appointed, spacious and very quiet.  Butler service was excellent, many free amenities including laundry/dry cleaning/pressing, etc.  Gym, spa and pool is also excellent, especially for a city hotel.Lobby area is also stunning.  Service was great from front desk, concierge, other service, etc.  My favorite is that I can simply communicate with their concierge via email at any time and they're very responsive. If rooms are available at the St. Regis, it should be a no-brainer to stay here.  "
"This St Regis is very well located near Union Square and Market St where all shoppings happen, has two major draw backs, ths little closet space at the metropolitan suites and the lousy food at the lobby bar. Not a decent place to eat besides ordering room service."
