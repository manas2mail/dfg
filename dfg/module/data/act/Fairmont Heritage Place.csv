Review
"Loved this property and could not speak more highly of the concierge service. Location is “touristy” according to my local family member. However, I would stay here again and again. To have a kitchen, w/d, 2 beds and 2.5 baths is priceless when traveling with young kids and having people over to eat. In short ..... STAY HERE! "
"Stayed in the residence for 3 nights! I loved our stay. It definitely feel more homey than hotels. The front desk staff were amazing and very responsive. The house car could use an upgrade. The door/bell staff definitely needs more training on customer service... they were not very polite, or helpful.. "
"If you ever plan to go to San Francisco go to this place! Great, spacious and clean rooms. Lovely staf and quick check-in and check-out. Breakfast was nothing special. Some fruits and bread and some pastries. Next time we come back we’ll be taking a room with a bay vieuw!✌️"
"We found this to be an excellent place to stay as a family. The rooms are very spacious and nice, lots of chocolate treats, and being part of Ghirardelli square with its games, shops and restaurants made for a great stay. I highly recommend. The area is really cool when lit up at night. Lastly, the breakfast was a great feature included with the room."
"These apartments are excellent and contain everything you need for a perfect stay in San Francisco.Situated perfectly near the Wharf area, it's a perfect spot to enjoy the attractions nearby - and near the terminus of one of the cable cars. Historic streetcars are also nearby.Staff were excellent - the inclusive bike hire and use of the town car within 2miles of the property were excellent benefits. Breakfast provision was excellent, too.Value wise it was on the verge of being unsatisfactory. Some of the facilities and rooms looked a little tired. The bed was a little firm and not 100% comfortable. Yes, you get a lot for your money but then you're paying a lot of money!Worth a stay if you prefer an apartment and can afford it."

"I stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment with myself and two teenagers last week. I needed extra space because I was working while the teens were touring. This was perfect. The kitchen, dining and living spaces were very large and elegant. The bedrooms and bathrooms were also a good size, so we all had plenty of room. The location is fantastic and the views of the bay and bridge were great. It's a bit pricey but having breakfast included, a kitchen for a few home cooked meals saved us the difference. The hotel also has a driver who will take you anywhere within 2 miles. The staff was very attentive and really cared that we had what we needed. We would return any time and highly recommend. "
"The hotel is amazing for proximity to everything, but I especially like being in on of the best places to run in the world. I really appreciate tg e staff, gym, breakfast, and very spacious rooms. From check in to check out it was a treat."
"Our family of five adored our recent stay. The staff were super friendly, knowledgable and helpful from the concierge through to the cleaning staff. We felt instantly at home and were given great restaurant recommendations. The two bedroom apartment was gorgeous and well appointed. Our kids loved the history of the chocolate factory. It is a fantastic hotel- great location, wonderful views, close to restaurants. Delicious breakfast. We will definitely stay here again and can't recommend it highly enough."
"We loved our stay here. We had a 2 bedroom ocean view. It was very generously proportioned. We are a family of five and it felt enourmous. There was more than enough space. Large bedrooms, beautiful bathrooms, and an enourmous living/dining room. The location is superb alongside Fishermans Wharf. The views from the apartment were lovely. Breakfast was delicious. The hotel is right next to the starting point for the cable car ride up town. The concierge staff were extremely helpful throughout; nothing was too hard. They organized restaurant bookings, car hire, bike rental and more. The hotel has a car which will take you anywhere within a two mile radius for free (although a tip is expected). It was generally always available whenever we wanted to use it. We have travelled extensively as a family and we cannot fault this hotel. Expensive but it was worth every cent."
"WOW! This hotel is perfectly situated close to everything you will want to see and do in San Francisco. Ghirardelli Square is such an awesome spot for a hotel and the local amenities are fantastic. What could be better than waking up in the morning to the smell of chocolate? Our room was really well appointed, had lots of space and we loved the ambiance of the converted warehouse. It was great to sit on the terraces at night and the breakfast buffet offered everything you need to start the day."
An absolutely beautiful bay view room. Fireplace controlled with a switch and air conditioning / heat available. Everyone was welcoming and the property is just gorgeous. Apartment style rooms stocked with pans / glasses/ etc. Would stay here again and recommend it highly. To consider: may want to bring ear plugs music is played in the courtyard past 9pm if that bothers you. 
"The best in San FranciscoWhere would you get a two bedroom large living room and a kitchen plus washing machine and dryer.Oh I forgot, how beautiful view of the bayBreakfast included,In my case I had a nice wear our meeting, working meeting"
"The Fairmont Heritage Place was a great place to stay over the New Years holiday with a family of four. We stayed in a two bedroom unit and absolutely loved the space it had to offer. A full kitchen, washer + dryer, and full baths for each bedroom were well worth the cost as well. Definitely consider staying here if you need the extra space. Also, take advantage of the hotel car during your stay -- it is usually available and the bellmen are more than happy to drive you anywhere in the city."
"We had a great 4 days in San Francisco staying at the Fairmont Heritage Place. Fabulous hotel and location to stay with a family. The Ghirardelli chocolate factory and shops were directly below and there were lovely views over the bay and Alkatraz. The rooms were large and tastefully decorated. We had a kitchen, living area and laundry (which was ideal when traveling with a family) The beds were so comfortable and we were able to get a roll out bed for our 3 rd child set up each night. A lovely continental breakfast was included in a nice communal lounge area and there was a hotel car service that was free for guests to use within a 2 mile radius (which got you to most of San Fran’s main attractions) The staff were friendly and accommodating (special thanks to Sebastian on the front desk) I would highly recommend this gorgeous boutique style hotel for a stay in beautiful San Francisco. "
Excellent property for family gathering. Great location and amenities for anyone traveling with kids. Breakfast provided and lots of great restaurants nearby. Friendly and accommodating staff. Will definitely be back again
We had our family Christmas there this year and it was really nice. The residence was spacious with a nice fireplace and Christmas tree. Felt like home. Steps away from the historic pier and fisherman’s warf. We really enjoyed our stay. The people were very nice and welcoming. 
"The staff were all extremely professional, accommodating and friendly - whether we were dealing with the front desk, the valets, night desks, maintenance housekeepers or concierge desk. The accommodation was ""home-like"" and spacious (we had a 2 bedroom duplex). The small touches were well appreciated (water & chocolates each night, being able to text requests the prior night for timing on car retrieval and housekeeping, continental breakfast spread every morning, the wine & cheese hour every evening etc.). The kitchenette was well-equipped (microwave, kettle, coffee maker, gas stove, oven, fridge/freezer (small) and we even had a large dining table attached to a mini kitchen island. Finally, the A/C & Heating system worked superbly. The only issues we had were 1) it took a very long time for hot water to come through the sink faucets throughout the suite, and 2) no room service. However, any food delivery service was able to deliver to the suite (accompanied by a staff member if required). Overall, for a long term stay (we stayed for almost 2 months), this was a home away from home and even the most discerning guest would feel comfortable and happy. We would strongly recommend the Fairmont Heritage to all travelers to San Francisco - whether for a short term or long term stay. We are residents of SF and so we didn’t appreciate Ghirardelli Square as much, but for visitors this will be an added bonus. The most important takeaway for future guests is the quality of the staff. They really care and it manifests itself in all that they do."
"My wife and took a brief vacation just before the Christmas holidays to visit, as she had never been - this was my 6th trip back to the area. After perusing all the 5 star properties in the city online, I chose this property primarily due to it's location . . . in the heart of San Francisco. Our two-bedroom suite was opulent and perfect; well appointed with high-end furnishings. The staff was amazing, friendly and helpful in so many ways. We were very pleased with everything!"
"I chose this hotel because it was near my daughters flat but it was great for the waterfront attractions, city centre and sea front park walks. the bed was so comfortable and the breakfast good. The staff were friendly and welcoming and overall this was a great stay."
"The hotel was absolutely beautiful, the doorman, concierge, driver, housekeeping, and the rest of the staff were so friendly and helpful. Our stay was AMAZING! 10/10 recommend. The waterfront location was so pretty with a direct view of Alcatraz. "
"While staying at the Fairmont Heritage Place at Ghiradelli Square, I received the best possible service one could receive while staying at a Fairmont. Having so many people being able to help and care for your stay is one of the best qualities a staff can have. The Doorman Tito and the concierge, Fabiola were a huge help in making our stay very delightful, and preventing any problems there could have been. I admire the butlers Cody and Dustin, along with the housekeeping team extremlely. They were always eager to assist and helped make our stay extremely pleasant. Having so many people ready to help and provide care was a very wonderful quality of the hotel. While staying here, we were able to have the best hot chocolate right downstairs, along with a chocolate shop on each side of the hotel. We were also very close to the piers with sea lions and the shops along Fishermans Wharf. My favorite part was that from our room we can see the island of Alcatraz. The view could not have been any better. We got to experience so much of San Francisco, and The Fairmont Heritage Place had a huge part in making it an amazing trip! I will definitely be making a trip back to the Fairmont Heritage Place at Ghiradelli Square."
"I visited and stayed at this hotel for 3 days and it was honestly an unforgettable truly amazing experience. For anyone visiting San Francisco I definitely recommend staying here! The Doorman Tito, Mr. Jean St.Aubin, the concierge Fibiola, the housekeeping team, The butlers Dustin and Cody made this trip 10x more worth it. AMAZING customer service I will surly recommend this hotel to anyone I know visiting the area. Thank you all for being so great."
"Location, inside space, and amenities were great. It is only 2 blocks from the SF Wharf and some wonderful restaurants. We have stayed there 4 times now as guests of friends and each time we had a great time. Of course, the Ghiradelli hot fudge sundaes are to die for too! My only negative is that the rooms are becoming a little weathered. They need touch up paint and some upgrading. One thing to remember is that it is a timeshare ownership facility and while the non owner public can stay there, it is very expensive."
"We decided on a staycation and booked a 3 night stay at the Fairmont GSQ. We stayed a 3 bedroom, 3 bathroom private residence. Not sure if there are regular hotel rooms...I don’t think so. Check-in was a breeze. We arrived a little earlier, so we dropped off our bags and slipped into Ghirardelli Square for a late lunch. The location is perfect for a walk by the beach, Fisherman’s Wharf, City Tours, Cable car rides, and lots of choices for breakfast/lunch/dinner. Don’t miss the walk down the pier for a perfect view of Golden Gate and Alcatraz, and rest your feet with an Irish Coffee at Buena Vista."
"Can’t say enough about the stay at the fairmont! Fabiola and Zach were great! They helped us with everything we needed and more. One of the most accommodating hotels I️ have ever stayed in. The rooms were spacious and the common area was perfect to entertain. Can’t wait to visit again!-Phillip Sgroi, NJ "
"Great, romantic place to stay.... helpful, friendly staff... but quiet and restful while still being close to everything. The rooms are terrific, large, open with great views. One of the best experiences was enjoying a glass of wine on the terrace with SF bay spread out in front of you."
"Only got to stay here 1 night, but it is a beautiful property in a great location with amazing views & service. The mustard Terrace & the fire pits is perfect for a cool morning with coffee &/or a chilly evening with wine."
"Lucky enough to stay in and I have to tell you concierge and housekeeping are the best I've ever experienced! not to mention the residence itself. Breakfast setting made me feel like I was one of members who's living there. Wine&cheese from 5 to 6 was nice perks too. And those restaurants by concierge (thank you, Fabiola!) were fantastic!! Highly recommended."
"This place is perfect for a traveling family. The service and space is impeccable. Our 2-bedroom suite was over 1000 SF with a complete kitchen, dining room / living room and 2 king bedrooms with gracious sized bathrooms. The hotel is actually 4 connected buildings - Cocoa, Mustard, Woolen and another which surround Ghirardelli Square. We had an amazing view of the Maritime National Park and could watch people swimming in the marina, while boats and cargo ships passed by in the bay. You can let the kids run on the grass in the park or head down to the beach. The Powell/Hyde cable car terminal is a few blocks from the hotel which can get you up the steep hills into the city to explore. Fisherman’s Wharf is also right there - but very touristy and busy so keep a tight grip on the kids. You don’t need to leave the property for breakfast (served 7-10am) it has a little bit of everything - cereals, fresh berries, yogurt, baked goods, oatmeal, and hard boiled eggs. Take advantage of the evening complimentary wine and take a glass to the private outdoor fire pit or the terrace at the Mustard building overlooking Ghirardelli Square. I also recommend letting the kids run free at the Botanical Gardens in Golden Gate Park (so many secret places to explore) and then head over to the California Academy of Sciences to see the aquariums, rainforest biome, penguins, pterosaurs and planetarium. Then head back to Fairmont Heritage Place for that well earned glass of complimentary wine. "
This our 4th visit to the Fairmont at Heritage Square. Excellent friendly staff Awesome complementary breakfast Unmatched view of the bayModern clean rooms w attractive art and comfortable beds w fine linen. 
"Overall, my friends and I enjoyed our one night stay at this amazing place. We were truly impressed with the high quality service from the staff and I am definitely coming back to stay here with family next time. The location is ideal for tourist and the options surrounding the 2 mile radius are enough to keep you busy for several days. The two bedroom home was great and 5 of us were able to stay there comfortably. We didn't even want to leave the place!"
"Years ago, as young marrieds, we were near Fisherman's wharf in a cheapish, cramped hotel room- dreaming of the day when we could spend our nights at one of the luxury hotels in the area. Well, last night it happened There is nothing pretentious about this property at all. From the bellmen to the managers.... hospitality perfected. Seriously. All of the employees were outstanding. I had reserved a one bedroom suite, but we got a two bedroom suite instead with no up charge. We just ""happened"" to arrive right before the Blue Angels performed air- o- batics over the Bay, for Fleet Week festivities. Chairs were set up on the second floor outdoor patio overlooking the Bay, so we had a wonderful view and perspective. You pay a premium for this location in the Ghiradelli building, but it is a lovely way to top off a San Francisco trip, being within walking distance of all that Fisherman's Wharf has to offer. We ate halibut at Scoma's, had a Ghiradelli Classic Hot Fudge Sundae at their fountain bar, and rode the streetcar at night. There is a wine and cheese reception and an adequate Cont. breakfast in the morning. Use your keycard to walk right out into the virtual middle of the action on the bay front. Only somewhat ""squirrely"" aspect of the accomodation is the check-in parking, which really cannot be helped, due to the nature of the location. It is one car spot on the corner in front of the entrance door. We valet parked since it made the most sense to expedite our check in process."
"This location is the best for the wharf area, Pier 39 and various cruise launches. The house car will take you within 2 miles when available. The staff is always excellent for your needs or wants. The sound system in the residence are great. Enjoy warming by the 2 fire pits with views."
"What a hotel! Must see in the hearty of Ghirardelli Square and you must go eat at Gary Danko- it’s the best restaurant in the city one block from the hotel doorstep. And I cannot forget to mention the amazing concierge Zack, who put our trip over the top with amazing recommendations and making life easy on his guests!!!"
"We stayed in San Francisco a few years ago and really enjoyed our visit. This visit was enhanced by staying in the Ghiraldelli district as it is a short walk from Fishermans Wharf which is where you want to be at night. We were also just a short walk from a tram stop which means it is easy to visit the other attraction San Francisco has to offer. As for the hotel, we were made welcome from the minute we were dropped off outside our hotel. We were shown around the hotel, advised of the complementary breakfast (which was first class) and the afternoon complemented wine and cheese. Finally we were lucky enough to be upgraded to a suite with two large bedrooms and an amazing lounge area. All in all a first class travel experience."
"We were also staying at the hotel when the fire alarm went off. Edward and his team couldn't have been more apologetic or helpful. They organised rooms for us in Santa Monica, contacted our other accommodation for them to help us out and went above and beyond to make sure we were okay. Edward even gave us three days worth of chocolates to keep the teenagers happy whilst traveling! The lady complaining in the previous review was approached and apologised to at breakfast. She wasn't happy with anything anyone said to her. I couldn't be more impressed with the way the situation was handled, I would stay here again for sure! "
This is our 3rd trip to the Fairmont Ghirardelli Square. We stayed last year and we had a few issues (including the fire alarm at 2am). We traveled back this week and I wanted to make sure that I noted a few things: They have upgraded the bedding and furniture - very nice! We had a beautiful 2 bedroom with a fireplace facing the SF Bay - beautiful view! We were welcomed with a nice welcome treat - thank you! I want to send a special thank you to Matt Haszel and Aurora Contreas for making our return to the Fairmont possible and enjoyable and they went above and beyond on customer service. The only downside were the valets who were not as friendly/helpful as they should have been. But that won't stop us from returning!
"WE have 4 kids so need to be comfortable. Fairmont Heritage was perfect. Great location, beautiful accomodation, great service with knowledgeable concierge. We were very happy and stayed 5 nights. It also has a great house car at your service, although it is difficult to get access during peak hours. Overall, we are staying their again for sure..."
"My family spent 4 nights at the Fairmont Heritage Place. During 3 of 4 early mornings (4am), the hotel fire alarm malfunctioned, triggering a mandatory evacuation. Hotel ""Management"" doesn't have a clue why system is malfunctioning - lots of excuses, but obviously don't know how to repair the problem. Didn't even get an apology after the first night alarm. Incredibly disappointing experience and response from the Fairmont. Stay away from this place!! "
"We are a party of 4 (2 couples)and wanted a nice place to stay in San Francisco for a couple of days. We booked at the Fairmont Ghirardelli Square. It was a 2 bedroom apartment with 2 master baths kitchen and living space. This is like your own high end apartment in San Francisco. All top end equipment, beautiful Bay views just from under the historical Ghirardelli sign just off the end of fisherman's wharf. It really gives you a high end feel as soon as you walk in but definitely as soon as you check out the rooms. It is reasonably priced for what your getting. Highly recommend it to all my friends and family!"
"To all the staff at Ghirardelli Square the Hall family would like to take this opportunity to thank you most sincerely for the most wonderful stay! From the moment we arrived we were looked after with impeccable attention to detail. Our apartment was out of this world with a wonderful bay view over to Alcatraz. We travelled as a family of four to celebrate our son's 21st birthday and the accommodation was perfect - so much room and so luxurious. The position of the apartment was perfect too with some lovely restaurants immediately in the square below including the ""famous"" Ghirardelli Chocolate Shop with the most wonderful hot chocolate sundaes - a must! You are also minutes of walking distance from the bay and a lovely beach area. We had a arranged a trip to Alcatraz and the amazing hotel staff went out of their way to purchase a dvd that was not in their library specifically for us to watch! It was delivered with a complimentary bottle of red wine to our room - absolutely amazing! The buffet breakfast was fantastic and the perfect way to start the day and complimentary cheese and wine is served every evening which is also such a lovely touch. There are two lovely terraces with firepits to sit and enjoy your glass of wine and soak in the amazing views. There is also a complimentary car service to take you to the main shopping at Union Square or any destination wished within reasonable distance - such a fantastic service. We cannot speak highly enough of this wonderful establishment and its exemplary staff. We would definitely love to visit again very soon! Kindest Regards to All from the Hall family x"
"Perfect location,amenities and staff. Corbin was fantastic and took care of all our needs. Would definitely recommend to stay. Rooms are spacious and clean. TV has all channels,washrooms supplies are plenty."
"From removing our bags from the car to putting the bags back, our stay was unbelievable. We had a 2 bedroom with a perfect view of Alcatraz. Everyone was very professional, suite was very clean. Would recommend and would return. "
"This hotel is a stunner. The rooms are beautiful. However, be advised that rooms 112, 114, and 116 are right alongside the Ghirardelli Square beer garden, complete with live music and loud, happy revelers DIRECTLY outside your room. Like, RIGHT outside. The hotel bills these as ""City View"" rooms. Seriously, the only part of the city you can see (and hear) are lots of visitors in the beer garden. It feels like they're able to look right in at you, although when you look from outside the glass is reflective. Still kept my curtains closed the entire time. Bummer."
"Outstanding atmosphere and customer service. we loved our stay with you. thank you ever so much again! I would recommend your facility to everyone. The location, the amazing rooms and views! thank you again."
"This hotel is essentially a condo property with high end amenities and services, as you would expect from a Fairmont. We have 2 tweens and were staying in San Fran for a few days before heading out to Yosemite for a week. The space was perfect with a king master and a second bedroom with two beds and it's own full bathroom, 4 bathrobes, cotton balls and q-tips, shampoos and conditioners, washer/dryer, living room, dining room table, and full kitchen (although we ate out for all meals), oh and turn down service. This sounds silly, but we also appreciated the bag of Peet's coffee that was the exact amount needed to make a pot of coffee, no measuring needed. It made a perfect pot. Housekeeping noticed we used it and made sure we had 2 bags of it everyday, so thank you for that! There is a continental breakfast served every morning and a Happy Hour every evening with wine and cheese. There are a lot of families staying here so both are kid friendly. There are two outdoor balconies with firepits that overlook Ghirardelli Square.I loved the location. It is in Ghirardelli square, so right out your door are nice shops and of course the chocolate and ice cream. There is also a beer garden with corn hole! It's far enough away from the larger tourist trap areas but in walking distance to Fisherman's Warf and Pier 39. We had a bay view which was awesome. Although the hotel does not have it's own restaurant, there are 3 in the square and the hotel concierge will order for you and have it delivered to your room. Just like room service. There are several other restaurants nearby as well. We are fans of Fairmont and appreciate their concierge texting system. You can be anywhere, send them a text asking for a dinner reservation or a car pick up, and they respond immediately. If you are use accustomed to other Fairmont hotels, you may want to know a few minor details. There is no grand lobby, but neat common spaces throughout the building, like the space for breakfast and happy hour and the terraces. It might be time to upgrade some of the bedroom dressers. They looked a little worn. It's also an older building so there are some corks to the layout of the units. Guess it all adds to the character!As always, we had a great Fairmont experience. On our way back out of town, we stayed at a different hotel since it was a quick overnight before heading to the airport and we were disappointed. So glad we chose the Fairmont!"
"The property is a time share residence that is perfectly situated for a family or couples first visit to San Francisco. Best way to and from the hotel is uber or lyft. Corbin dand his team delivered nothing short of a fantastic experience. From the complimentary bottle of wine upon arrival to finding a way for is to tolerate the hardest mattress I've ever experienced in my life. Breakfast in the morning is bare minimum continental and is sorely in need of a protein. That said breakfast at the fire pit was always wonderful. The complimentary wine and cheese tasting at 5pm only goes for an hour but does occur all 7 days of the week. All in all, we had a great time. "
"The Fairmont Heritage Place is a fantastic place to base yourself to explore San Francisco. It is in Ghirardelli Square which is a fantastic location.We booked a two bedroom apartment to accommodate our family from the UK. I have to say, we definitely saved the best to last. The beds were comfortable, including the sofa bed. The accommodation was well stocked and clean. Great use of the washing machine and dryer which were easy to use. Fantastic views of Alcatraz and the bay area from our suite. The outside terraces were perfect, especially after a long day exploring the city,What truly made this accommodation stand out was the superb staff, nothing was too much, but they were discreet enough that they almost blended into the background. They decorated the suite as we were celebrating my husband's birthday, and arranged a birthday cake. Any requests or inquiries we had were met with ease.Having experienced a Fairmont residency, we would not hesitate to try it again and would definitely book to stay at the Fairmont Heritage Place again.Perfect end to a tiring trip."
Great views close to Great Restaurants. Safeway close by for groceries and the in suite kitchen is well stocked for any in room meals you might wish to prepare. Also in suite washer and dryer comes in very handy to cut down on over packing.
This self catering hotel is in a great location and the apartments are a good size and well maintained. It is not cheap and as it is self catering the room service is a little limited. If I had the money and was a regular visitor to San Francisco then I'd love to own a share in one of these apartments. Concierge and reception are great.
"This place is fantastic. The location is great and the facilities are outstanding but what really makes this property stand out is the staff and their friendly service to their guests.These are basically full condos with a kitchen (upscale Wolf equipment), washer/dryers and beautifully appointed living rooms and bathrooms. There is a continental breakfast served every morning if you don't feel like cooking and a Happy Hour every evening with wine and cheese.It is in Ghirardelli square, so right out your door are lots of nice shops and of course all of the sweets you could possibly eat.From the moment you arrive and the staff helps you with your luggage until you leave, there are many friendly members of the staff to assist with anything that you need. All requests are met with people who are eager to help and are well trained in their jobs.Want room service? - no problem, food can be delivered from a variety of restaurants and you have a full dining room to sit and enjoy. Want to work out in the morning - there is a nicely equipped fitness center right there. Want to bike to bridge - they offer complimentary bikes to their guests. Want to go to Union Square to do some shopping - they have a House Car that will take you anywhere within a 2 mile radius, which in SF is a lot of the city, and it is free.Basically, you are made to feel at home and fully relaxed while having the opportunity to explore SF at your leisure."
"When reserving, make sure you ask for the bay views because otherwise, you get the street under construction on North Point....believe the rooms are even numbered for the bay views...regardless the square below is littered with shops for eating, wine tasting, and souvenirs, including chocolate....our room was a 2 bedroom suite with kitchen which we used a bit for leftovers to refrig and chill wine.....nice fitness center as well; free continental breakfast and happy hour daily...."
"My family of 5 stayed in a 2-bedroom unit with a beautiful view of the Bay. It featured a very comfortable living/dining/kitchen area and spacious bedrooms/baths. Ghiradelli Square is a lively place with shops and restaurants right outside the door of the hotel. The staff are very helpful and will bring you take-out meals from the nearby restaurants. One fellow from Guest Services even helped me arrange a driver/tour guide on the spot when the private tour we arranged fell through. For the location, view, accommodation quality, and attentive service, I give the Fairmont Heritage 5 stars."
"Great location and nice rooms but no restaurant nor bar in the property, not to mention the cheap breakfast... Quite overpriced when you realize it actually is a residence not a hotel! Shameless use of the Fairmont brand which normally offers hugely more value"
"What a great hotel! Friendly, courteous staff. Clean. Met our every need. Great location. Walking distance to most attractions. Apartment style suite of rooms better than expected. Our two teenagers each had their own bedroom and bathroom. Beautiful view. Firepit with outdoor seating very quaint. Will definitely stay here again. "
"We stayed through Exclusive Resorts at the Fairmont Heritage Place, Ghirardelli Square. The location was magnificent but this review will be about the staff and concierge. We had great, great service experience here. They took care of us with dinner reservations, had a car to take you within a couple miles of the hotel (we didn't use that), and just would do nearly anything to please you. It was a really great experience. Also the hotel had two viewing decks. One to sit outside that overlooked the bay and one that overlooked the square. Firepits at both. It was a lovely way to end each evening. It was just a special place to call home for a few days."
"My girlfriend group and I stayed four nights and so many details about this place were attended to. Every single staff member I encountered could not have been more polite and genuinely helpful. The new Suburban shuttle is free within a 2-mile radius and most things are in that area. We used it often and never had to wait long. All drivers were courteous and knowledgeable. The breakfasts were continental and had delicious fresh coffee (great decaf, too), lovely fresh fruit and pastries. Newspapers were available at no charge. Of course the location is fantastic! You are steps away from great restaurants and shops (including Ghiradelli chocolate)! Our group enjoyed the fire pit area one evening. Another plus! Beds were comfy and bathrooms roomy. As no maid service was provided, we washed our towels in the provided stackable set. All in all I would highly recommend this place. It seemed family friendly, too. "
"The Fairmont Heritage Place has ample space when traveling with family and friends. Great concierge service, continental breakfast, and use hotel vehicle. Awesomely located in Ghirardelli Square in the Fishermans Wharf area. Easy walking to many attractions. "
"The rooms at the Fairmont in Ghirardelli Square are really more like loft apartments. Spacious, beautiful and comfortable. Full size kitchen and wonderful views. It was a little more than we needed for 1 night in town but I could see coming back with the kids for an extended stay. There's no restaurant or bar on property but plenty to choose from within walking distance. It's kind of a kitschy , touristy area to stay."
"we had a wonderful time in the city, the room was beautiful, we got upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment, staff very helpful and attentive, we loved that the room had a wine fridge, real wine glasses, plates, cups, glasses. "
Best location for Fishermans Wharf!! Great support from concierges. We enjoyed the daily breakfast that gave us a great start. High end appliances and surround sound in the master bedroom and living area. Sitting by the fire pit and looking out at the bay is very restful.
Your going to love this place. There was al lot to do every day that we were there. And the food was amazing. Just to be away from home and vacation on a city like San Francisco is the best we all enjoyed it as a family
"Our multigenerational family had three residences in this lovely propety. We had views of San Francisco Bay and were within walking distance to Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39 and the cable car depot which enabled us to get to Union Square easily. The hotel is very unique and very comfortable. The staff is excellent, especially concierge Alex who helped us plan many aspects of our stay. I would highly recommend this property."
"Great location, great views of Alcatraz , loved the balcony roof top with fire pit always on 24 /7 great time I will definitely come back to the Fairmont when I return to San Francisco . Girradeli Square right below my room with shops and restaurants steps away had a great experience there for sure "
"We loved the enormous, luxurious suite with high ceilings and exposed brick. It was beautiful and very clean. I loved having my own laundry in the suite. Breakfast was civilized and not a zoo like some hotels. Silverware was spotless too! Staff was pleasant and helpful."
Location and accommodations can't be beat. Zach went out of his way to make sure our stay was perfect! He arranged the AUDI car rental service for a day and we drove to the vineyards. Car was delivered and picked up from the hotel and very reasonable rates for an awesome car. 
"Five of us spent the weekend in a three bedroom unit on the second floor. The apartment was spacious, immaculate and accommodating. We are from the East Coast an it reminded us of an upscale apartment in NY. We were quite pleased. The housekeeping service was exceptional. For the priice, the wine and cheese service in the afternoon was below average. The Breakfast was ok. We ordered a bottle of wine that was listed on a card and waited an hour and a half for service. What you don't focus on is there is a $25 service charge on top of a gratuity to order anything. We ran out to the square rather than spend another $65 for a mediocre bottle of wine. Bottom line from our point of view, nice hotel, nice people, good location but we missed hotel services."
"What can I say: it's the closest thing to a perfect hotel! The location is great: two blocks from Fisherman's wharf and great restaurants. The complementary house car will bring you to any other great spot within a two miles radius. The staff are wonderful: positive attitude and always willing to help. The concierge got us great seats at an Oakland A's game. He also organised our rental car which arrived as planed, on the morning of our departure, all at a advantageous price and a waived airport return fee.The complimentary breakfast is good and the late afternoon complementary wine and cheese offers a great transition from afternoon visits to an evening program.The rooms are very spacious, well equipped with stylish finishes. We had reserved a one bedroom suite with kitchen and living room but were upgraded to a two bedroom suite, each with its own bathroom. It included a washer and dryer which was useful for longer 4 day stay. The solid wood floors and the brick walls added the perfect touch to create a warm home like atmosphere.All in all, great value for money. It really made our trip to San Francisco a great success."
"We had a number of visitors coming to San Francisco. We wanted a comfortable place for they to stay.We booked a two bedroom suite at the Fairmont Heritage. It was pricey, but the accommodations were very good, and the suite could handle 6 people easily.The visitors were comfortable, and the facilities were very convenient (full kitchen, laundry). When issues arose (coffee maker was not working) the staff responded promptly and resolved the issue.The morning coffee and light breakfast was very good, as was the evening wine and cheese opportunity. "
"The Fairmont Heritage is one of those few remaining outposts of civilization in our world. The staff are professional and go that one step beyond being merely friendly and helpful. It’s effortless to stay there. The rooms are spotless, comfortable and pleasing to the eye in that way that your home is, when it is. If you enjoy the area, the location is perfect. Recommended."
"We recently visited San Francisco during a Spring break with our three youngest children ( 11,9 and 8). The ""residence"" as the associates at this property like to (and accurately) refer to the Fairmont Heritage Place was more like a working urban apartment than a hotel suite. We had two large bedrooms, each with it's own bath, a nice sized kitchen with a large dining table and all of the amenities were first class. The location of this ""residence"" makes it ideal for a family to visit San Francisco without ever needing to rent a car. Fisherman's Wharf/ Pier 39 and the Exploratorium are all within walking distance as is the turn- about for the Powell/Hyde cable cars. The balcony looks out onto the Ghirardelli Plaza and if the breeze is just right, you can smell the aroma of the chocolate from the nearby store. A first class property ( sorry, residence) to be sure."
"Love this place!! Had a 2 bedroom on 4th floor overlooking Bay and Alcatraz. Great amenties such as high end kitchen, beautiful bathrooms, washer/dryer, continental breakfast, hour long evening wine and cheese reception, great fitness center, fire pit outdoor seating area, great location in Ghirardelli square.Although, the best amenity is the great staff. Michael, Zach and Shah were among the many that made this an amazing stay. Will definitely be back when in San Fran."
"This is a great property for a family vacation. You can get rooms with 1-3 bedrooms. They are essentially high end apartments; well appointed with full kitchens, washer/dryer and great bay views (from the wool building). The staff is great and highly attentive. They have a great gym and free bikes you can use to tour around the city. A house Escalade can get you anywhere within 2 miles of the hotel. The location is easy walking distance from a lot of great sights and driving access is easy if you want to get out of the city to Marin county quickly. The continental breakfast is good and the wine/cheese in the evenings around the fire pits on the patio is a nice touch. We'll definitely be back. Good job Fairmont. "
We recently stayed 3 nights at this hotel and were overwhelmed by the level of service provided. Every detail was addressed and staff were extremely friendly. The accommodations were contemporary with a touch of old world class. Our room had an excellent view of Ghiradelli Square and the bay. Accommodations were so comfortable that it was hard to leave the room!
"There are plentiful reasons to love what Fairmont has done with this former infamous chocolate factory. They all come with a hefty price tag, so the standard of review must live up to the cost being paid. The lodging is beautiful and ideal for families visiting this amazing city. We were in a 2 bedroom unit with ""city view."" Despite the fact that the ""city view"" consisted of staring at the other side of the street, which is a run down unpleasant mess, the room itself was loaded with charm, clean, and well serviced. The location of the property is equally as ideal, within easy walking distance of the charming Wharf, and a short stroll from the Hyde-Powell trolley line. The hotel offers a ""house car"" for free rides anywhere within 2 miles, which we made use of on a couple of occasions. Our drivers were fun and gracious. SF has large hills and walking even short distances isn't always a good idea depending on where you're headed, unless in work out mode. So the car is great. The staff are largely nice and accommodating. We had a rental car, and our coming and going with it was always handled quickly and efficiently. BIG plus points for the staff on duty on Sunday morning March 19th. We needed to leave at 3 am to get to the airport, and our car was waiting outside when we emerged ready to go. Thanks! The only issues we had our entire 4 night stay were upon check in. I had asked (and agreed to pay a fee) for early check-in, because we had flown in from the east coast and had been awake since 2 am our time. We arrived at 12:30 pm SF time to be told that request had not been accepted. No reason was given. I found it very odd to offer paid early check-in and then the hotel not follow through. The staff member dealing with us smiled a lot, gave us a brief tour, but offered little else but a sorry. I was told I'd be texted no later than 4 pm of our readied room. So my exhausted family wandered the area aimlessly for 3 1/2 hours waiting. No text ever came. I returned to the front desk at 4 pm to find another staff member, and learned our room was ready to go. From that point forward, we had nothing but a great experience. But that check in situation was handled very poorly, considering the cost of service prepaid in advance for. This is why I only give 4 stars. In final assessment...this place is wonderful. I'd stay here again without hesitation. "
"Outstanding service, above and beyond, starting from the moment our car dropped us off at the front door. Shah at check-in was super helpful. We had pre-paid a 3BR suite for 4 nights, but there was heavy road construction going on. Shah let us tour a quieter 2BR unit on the opposite side and eventually moved us to a quieter 3BR suite. The suite is well-appointed, large kitchen/living room area (pull out sofa bed makes it a 4BR!). Then each of the 3 bedrooms all had connecting full baths. Nothing extraordinary but very nice clean and spacious. Washer dryer took longer than usual to complete cycle, but Fairmont had detergent/dryer sheets stocked. The 5-6pm wine and cheese offering is nice, as is the continental (no eggs or meats) breakfast. Again, nothing extraordinary but 3.5 - 4 stars, close enough when travelling with kids. The house car was available 90% of the time. Nice young men driving, very polite and knowledgeable about the city. The overall experience travelling with 4 kids is 5 stars all the way. We will stay here again on our next visit to SF!Tip: enjoy your wine by the fire pit on the 2nd floor overlooking the square, it's lovely at 5pm. Also yelp eats 24 delivers, we tried north beach pizza and sushi in. All passable 3.5-4 stars."
"We stayed at the Fairmont a couple of times now and we’re always surprised by the generosity and exceptional guest services. This time, we booked a 2 bed/2.5 bath room. It was large – the livingroom had a great view of the pier and a nice fireplace which was great since it does get a bit chilly even during summer months. We loved that this apt had a washer/dryer and a complete kitchen. We were able to walk to a lot of the main attractions – pier, Ghirardelli, etc. It was really beautiful at night with the lights around the pier and the city view. The hotel also has a complimentary car service if you needed a lift to further places. We couldn’t be happier and we will be back!"
"We stayed for the fourth year in a row on the same weekend in a two bedroom unit at the Fairmont Heritage Place. It's inside the Ghiradelli Square. This place is not only fantastic, it's perfect for families since the units are spacious, with a small family room, dining table and kitchen.Our kids look forward to this trip since if we ever have a break in our schedule or they want to take an excursion on their own (the oldest is 14 and then 12) - they go to the chocolate store inside the complex to get a sundae or buy a treat. This is a fantastic property, within blocks of Fisherman's Wharf. It's great for families with children, and is luxurious in itself."
"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Fairmont Heritage Place for a week on vacation. We had both been to San Francisco for work before but this was our first time for pleasure. The hotel is an apartment style hotel including living room, kitchen, and dining room. The property is located on Ghirardelli Square which is a perfect location with easy access to Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39, and the Golden Gate Bridge. Bike rental is right near by. It is also is walking distance to Chinatown, and North Beach. In addition to the great location, I cannot say enough about the quality of the property. Amenities were excellent, the rooms are very clean, the sheets are comfortable, and the fixtures and bathrooms are luxurious. The staff is more than helpful, courteous, and attentive. When you book, as for the free continental breakfast everyday and wine and cheese hour every afternoon. All in all, this is a wonderful destination for couples on a romantic getaway and for families with children who need more room than a standard hotel room. It really served as more than just a hotel room during our stay, I felt like it was a home away from home. I plan to stay at the Fairmont Ghirardelli Square every time I come to San Francisco."
"Our experience at the Fairmont Heritage in Ghirardelli Square was beyond our expectations in every respect. From the superlative concierge team and porters/doormen/drivers (house car made available for trips less than 2 miles) and housekeeping staff, our every need was taken care of from start to finish. The accommodation itself was amazing, and it will certainly take a lot to get me to stay anywhere else in San Francisco. Both of our boys said ""Dad this is awesome"" which it indeed was. Access to transport, downtown and tourist destinations was excellent."
This is a really nice apartment style hotel so it has very big rooms. You get all the amenities of an apartment including a full kitchen and washing machine / dryer. All the fittings are of high standard and well maintained. It is also conveniently located in the same square as Ghirardelli Chocolates and a number of restaurants and has a great view of San Francisco harbour. Fisherman's Wharf and the Cable Car stop are within easy walking distance just down the road. It is not cheap but if you are after apartment style facilities with hotel service it is highly recommended.
The service from the moment you arrive is tremendous. Concierge to butler to wine service staff are top notch trained and amazing. The rooms are sooo clean and comfortable. We stayed in a 2 bedroom on the deck that had the most amazing view of the bay. Full kitchen and comfortable couches and chairs too. Can't wait to come back. Thanks. 
"First time staying at this luxury residential style property. Great location, close to all you need after work or not. Staff is biggest asset, they care to make a difference and ask question in order to help. If You re up to it bikes are available too.Thank you fairmont team,"
"I stayed in a two bedroom suite and it was very nice. I would not call it luxury hotel - but a more luxurious version of an extended stay hotel. The location was not great for my family, but the valets were quick and Ubers are easy in SF I would stay there again with family - although the prices were very high."
"I stayed at the Fairmont for 3 nights in a 2bedroom apartment with my wife and my mother in law. From the moment we arrived we were welcomed like old friends. We arrived rather late after a long haul flight and then a 6 hour drive from LA to San Fran. Suffice to say by the time we arrived at the Hotel we were pretty exhausted but we were met and checked in by Michael who was one of the highlights of our stay. He was professional, personable, interesting and he thought of everything. By the time he had shown us around the hotel, our bags were in our room, our car had been parked and i'd received a text from Michael making himself available should we need anything at all. Alex, and Anna were also exceptional in all of our dealings with them and they are assets to the Hotel. This was my second time in San Fran but my first visit was rather fleeting so to be in Ghiradelli square at Christmas time was magical. The chocolate shop and the restaurants are literally on the doorsteps to the hotel and the square was lit up with christmas lights and christmas trees. Really festive vibe. We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment which was lovely. I think they've got it right with the mix of modern furnishings but also maintaining some of the properties history brick exterior. Fairmont obviously manage some of the world's greatest hotels, and the 5 star service ethic is evident throughout this hotel also. On the occasions we ordered room service, asked for anything from the concierge, or made use of the butler or valet parking service, every request was met with efficiency and a genuine willingness to be of assistance. I will absolutely stay here again next time i am in San Fran."
"Successful conversion of old chocolate factory. Decoration is elegant and understated. The 2-bedroom suite (with a sofa bed in the living room) is perfect for families. Music piped throughout the suite via Sonos system. There is a fridge, as well as washing and drying machines. The fitness room has minimal equipment, but it's empty most of the time anyway. These nice assets are undermined by a policy of deliberate understaffing, which leads to subpar service: We came in early when our room was still being cleaned; promises to text us when the room was ready and to send our luggage up were forgotten. Rapid cleaning in the morning and NO turndown service in the evening. No water bottle. No slippers, so you walk barefoot on sticky wooden floor. Complimentary breakfast, but it's a continental one, no hot dish. You would never see such shortcomings at a Four Seasons, Mandarin Oriental, Shangri-La, Park Hyatt, St Regis, and certainly not at the urban properties of Aman or Banyan Tree. In fact, this seems to be positioned more as a premium serviced apartment that also rents by the day, rather than a luxury hotel."
"Just completed a stay in a two bedroom bay view suite. There are some great things about this hotel; location, staff, house car (if available), size of rooms. That said, I am giving the low rating for: no mini bar, limited room service, and bottled water (lack thereof). I paid $1400 per night. I called the front desk and asked for some bottled water and I was told it was $4 per bottle. I'm sorry, at $1400 per night you need to include bottled water at turn down. I'll stay elsewhere next time. Wow, for a few dollars they could have kept a customer. "
"Met in the City to celebrate birthdays of son and grandson. This is an ideal location for families, especially if not familiar with SF. The condos were very nice, well-stocked kitchen. The staff andservice were impeccable. We usually stay at the Fairmont/Nob Hill but this facility is perfect for family get-togethers. There are lots of restaurants w/in walking distance as well as shops. The view from our condos were great: we could see swimmers in the harbor and Alcatraz looked like it was just across the street from us! The only negative was the noise from a private party at the restaurant below us one night that lasted until midnite. "
"The Fairmont was the perfect location. The staff were all wonderful and went above and beyond for us. The week went much too fast. Surrounded by fun shops and great restaurants. Great chocolates also, after all it's Ghirardelli Square!"
"We spent a quick 3 day weekend there with our boys (10&13). 2 bedroom suite was perfect for us. Amazing location right there in Ghiradelli square. Convenient continental breakfast, happy hour and car service. It is not inexpensive, but well worth it for the location and comfort."
"If you are thinking of a place to stay this is it.Large rooms, clean, staff cant hep enough but don't get in the way.Food is excellent cheap places to eat or expensive what ever you want, you can walk to the wharf and catch the trams, Boat to Alcatraz or a Hop on Hop off busWe had 5 in our apartment and not crammed in (t bedroom apartment with a Sofa bed in the main living area.Thank you Fairmont"
"Great location, friendly helpful staff, excellent service levels, large two bedroom unit well appointed and maintained. Complementary transportation service in 2 mile radius was nice surprise and very helpful. "
"Fantastic location, amazing views, lovely room and friendly staff, what more can you ask for!Breakfast is very basic, but you can't beat sitting on the balcony beside the fire with a toasted bagel........oh yes you can wine and cheese time between 5-6pm!We asked to hire the bikes, no problem. We asked for the house car, no problem. Basically anything you need the staff will sort as you would expect from such a expensive hotel and I would be back in a heartbeat."
"Lovely stay at the fairmont Heritage place! Nice area, very close to art galleries and restaurants. Friendly staff and very welcoming. A home away from home type of feel. truly enjoyed the stay and will be coming back."
"The place is great, the staff is fine but be careful as one of the staffers scratched my laptop screen useless and the lady who contacted me on this issue was very aggressive and suggested I was lying."
"The Fairmont Ghiradelli Square is amazing! We had a 2 bedroom 2.5 bathroom residence for 3 couples and it's the best place to stay in San Fran! The rooms were wonderful, the staff was excellent, and the hotel amenities are superb. From the house car that can drop you off and pick you up anywhere within a 2 mile radius, to the complimentary breakfast, wine and cheese, to the outdoor rooftop lounges overlooking the bay, we had such a great time! The location is perfect, close to all the action. And Ghiradelli square has a lot to offer as well. Check in and check out was a breeze and every single staff person we encountered was courteous and enthusiastic. I definitely recommend this hotel and will for sure stay there again! "
"It saddens me to write this review because my wife and I have loved this hotel for years. The location and views are still some of the best in San Francisco. However, the awesome hotel service, knowledge and friendly staff, amenities and charm has disappeared! Really wanted this to not be the case and tried to over come this multiple times during our four day stay. As a Fairmont Presidents Club member, I want this property to continue its reign as a premier property in San Francisco, however those days appear to be long gone. A few key examples: Upon checking in and getting to the $1,250+ a night room, there was not a bottle of water to be found and when asking for one it was as if we asked for something very outside the norm. After traveling all day, how would they not place even two small bottles water by the bedside?Turndown service is bare. Property used to put one small Ghiradelli chocolate on the pillow because of the building it's housed in. Now nothing. No water, no chocolate, no amenities of any kind. Additionally, housekeeping just stacks towels on top of each other. They don't place on towel racks or present the way normal luxury hotels do. Common areas don't get cleaned regularly. Beer bottles and smoked cigar butts were sitting out on the common area deck tables from the night before until 3pm the next day. Come on! I had a guest come up and visit me for a cup of coffee at 10am and it was too gross to sit outside of our room in the common area and talk because it was dirty from the night before from other guests. Additionally, the iconic outside fireplace that is in all the brochures of this property was never turned on and never worked. This fireplace used to run regularly and was iconic for this Fairmont property. Now it doesn't burn, which is a great symbolic connection in the fact that the sizzle and soul of this property is gone too. In the morning my wife needed a very basic hygiene item and when we called the front desk, they sent us to a liquor store across the street that was closed. The staff didn't state they could assist with getting this common hygiene item, know where to send us or frankly take any concern for trying to find a way to truly help us. In the past, the level of care the hotel had for its guests was one of the finest things about this Fairmont. Now, its as if they are all overwhelmed and under resourced. It's important to note that I did contact the hotel manager Mr. Nassir and leave a message with the front seaside that I wanted to speak with him, but he apparently wasn't in. Later I asked for the manager on duty and there was a very polite women that I spoke with. But frankly she didn't have any empathy when I expressed my concerns that the service has gone drastically gone down. Once I told her that I was only contacting her because I care about this property and the Fairmont brand, and did not want anything free or comped she seemed relieved. I am happy to pay for luxury hospitality, as that's what I signed up for. However that is certainly not what the Fairmont Heritage Place, Ghirardelli Sq offers any longer. "
Great stay! Wonderful residence and staff! Would definitely stay here again when visiting San Francisco since the location was perfect for restaurants and sightseeing. I was very pleased with the quality of service and decor of the hotel
"Hosted a cocktail party for my daughter's engagement. The location is amazing with the most beautiful view of the San Francisco Bay, Alcatraz and the bridges!! The facility is top notch and the Staff are professional extremely helpful and what you would expect from the Fairmont Residence. One of the best places in the city."
"If you don't want to stay in the busy Union Square area, Fisherman's Wharf is perfect for tourists. I got a great deal on a popular travel site - let's just say it was a little under the normal $800-1000/nt for a 1 bd, 1 ba - although, the rate was still higher than the other hotels around the area. Let me just say that I am so glad I booked here! This place definitely made my trip! I was celebrating my 30th and SF was our last stop before heading home from a week long vacation. The whole staff was genuinely friendly and helpful (atleast, the people we encountered were.) The rooms are gorgeous! The pictures really do no justice. Even though our home does not look quite this clean, right when we walked in the door, it gave us this home-like feel you can't really explain. The interior designer did an amazing job. The ceiling is high so it feels big inside. And the fact that there is a lil piece of history here is so cool! The room was so comfy, we didn't even want to step foot outside our door. But, of course we forced ourselves to. The hotel had 2 house cars - which is avail on a first come, first serve basis. I had anticipated to cab it most of the time but I think we were lucky there was one available most of the time we requested it. To say the least about my experience here, this Fairmont Heritage location MADE the SF trip. I want to praise housekeeping and the bellman/valet crew for their promptness and mannerisms. As well as, Michael who checked us in! Thank you so much Michael for what you did. It was unexpected and we loved our short stay here! You made my 30th birthday a memorable one for sure!!! Mahalo!"
"Very well situated next to the chocolate factory. Need I say more? Great transport, they have a courtesy limo that will take you 2 miles, and they have bus stops right outside. Its a short walk down to the marina with several historic ships to visit. The Balclutha and her history is extremely well presented and again just a short downhill walk. There is a small business room beside the breakfast lounge which is perfect for printing your boarding passes. There is also a 'Mustard Deck"" with a fire pit where you can sit and enjoy the views across the bay to Alcatraz."
"We had the opportunity to stay here in October 2013 and it was exquisite!!! (Finally getting around to reviewing).This is actually a residence, fractional ownership property. We don't own here, but we stayed in one of the 3 bedroom units for 2 nights/3 days. When we booked a concierge contacted us and was our personal concierge for the entire stay. He asked us what we would like to have our fridge stocked with and then personally went shopping for us. WOW! That is completely unexpected and the ultimate level of customer service! The property is beautiful and in the perfect location. Close to Fisherman's Wharf but not too close to be embedded with the tourist crowd. Right on the water and an easy walk through the Marina District to the Presidio, Cow Hollow, Crissy Park or Palace of the Fine Arts. Ghiradelli Square is attached to the property and a perfect spot to spend a day and relax, with anything chocolate. A terrace to die for. So relaxing, overlooking San Francisco Bay, and watching the sun rise and set by a large fire place. OK, it is expensive, but completely worth it. The service your receive, the quality of the suites, the location, and the property, this was one of the best properties we have ever stayed at.Thank you for a great stay, we thoroughly enjoyed it, and felt like we were at home."
We traveled with 3 generations. The property was perfect for all of us. We enjoyed Nice bay view from the room and also good atmosphere at fire pit on lanai. Kids also enjoyed a safe fireplace. Breakfast buffet was easy to get us going in the morning and tasty too. 
"I've had a hard time finding somewhere to stay while in San Francisco that I'm excited to book back at and finally have found that in the Fairmont Ghirardelli. The room was absolutely stunning, modern, and clean. Great location close to fisherman's wharf and marina. Will be back!"
"Traveling with my family I am always on the lookout for SPACE and this property is exceptional in this regard. Rather than booking one or two hotel rooms, or even a suite at another hotel, here we had the equivalent of a 2 bedroom modern luxury apartment! Before our trip I read the reviews here and noted that some guests were critical of the wear and tear in some of the units. I can say that the only issue we had was one of the headboards was clearly damaged. When I brought this up to the front desk I was informed that the property was upgrading to new headboards in all the rooms this week."
"Stayed at Fairmont Ghiridelli for the Labor Day weekend. The hotel is lovely, a. Great location and has amazing views. The town call is very convenient and will drop you off within the city. Our 2 bedroom had beautiful bay views. Very friendly staff. Perfect in every way!"
"Great location for all the sights in SF. Stayed in 2 Bed which was spacious and comfortable. Street level noise can be heard early morning though. However, it aids an early start to maximise your stay!"
"We had an amazing vacation, there were 4 adults and 3 children (under age of 11). The staff was very friendly and accommodating to our needs. The hotel was in a great location within walking distance of most area attractions. The room was very modern and spacious with high end amenities. We will definitely be back here next time we visit the San Francisco Bay Area. Thanks again to the staff that went out of their way to be friendly and accommodating made our visit feel special! "
"Luxurious accommodation, with modern ammenities in a perfect location for exploring the city whether on business or on holiday. Most helpful concierges and car service to most parts of the city. Attractive terraces to sit on for relaxation and meeting friends. A place definitely to be stayed at again."
"Almost hidden above Ghiradelli Square is the Fairmont. Very spacious suites with semi private terraces overlooking the SF Bay and all of Fisherman's Wharf. Not inexpensive, but far better than the alternatives in the neighboorhood."
"We had a wonderful stay, fantastic accomodations and the staff was exceptional! Would recommend this to everyone. It was truly a home away from home and I felt very secure within the building. Beautiful accomodations and the business center was comfortable and accessable."
Made the trip to the Bay Area in mid July. Had been recommended by a close friend to stay at this property. Turned out to be a fantastic recommendation. Great views with even better service. From the time you arrive to the time you leave the staff makes your comfort a priority. Will defiantly stay again the next time in the area.
I highly recommend the Fairmont Heritage. Rooms are very nice and spacious especially for a family of four. Views are spectacular and we enjoyed sitting by the fire pits. Location was great and plenty of things to do to keep our family busy. I will definitely stay here again. 
"Staying in 2 bedroom suite of 52 suite Fairmont property and building retains the original brick on the inside of the old Cocoa Building of the chocolate making Factory...excellent staff and concierge; free driving service within a couple miles to shop and dine although uBer readily available...ate at McCormick's and Kuleto's for lunch in Ghirardelli Square....perfect views of the Bay and awesome food and service...dozens of restaurants, wine bars and other shops in the Square below the hotel and live music on a beautiful weekend...."
"Welcoming, top notch service, gorgeous condos with incredible views of the bay. Excellent location, enjoyed breakfast & evening wine/cheese hour. House SUV a real plus! Staff was extremely welcoming and helpful. Also, enjoyed McCormacks restaurant nearby."
"Maybe a good spot for out of town people looking for a very nice room in the middle of the most touristy part of the waterfront. We liked the rooms a lot, but wouldn't go back. The area seems more safe than many other parts of SF, but the night we were there a murder occurred in Aquatic Park - about 300 yards away... "
"Just about to leave after 5 days here. Wonderful stay, upgraded to a suite with views over the harbour. Waxmans next door for some great food, take out is better and go and sit on the roof deck next to the fire pit with a bottle of champagne. Really good, will be back."
"Stayed at the Fairmont heritage for a week with Grandaughter. Location was great, wonderful wonderful accommodations and the staff went above and beyond!! Breakfast was the only thing I would give a lower rating. Loved our stay wish I could give the staff and accommodations a higher rating!!"
We had a delightful time at the Fairmont and very much enjoyed our fully equipped 3 bedroom apartment. The staff was very courteous and helpful. The location is ideal and the outside terraces overlooking Ghirardelli square and the bay are awesome. There was some wear and tear in the rooms which could use a little remodeling. The location is perfect for enjoying bay views and the action of Ghirardelli square. It's also a short walk to Fisherman's wharf and close enough to the heart of the city without the hustle and bustle. Take advantage of the courtesy Escalade and the wine and cheese hour.
"This is a beautiful hotel and the location is perfect. My family of 4 children and 2 adults stayed in the 2 bedroom condo. It was very spacious, clean and well maintained. There is a washer and dryer, full kitchen, 2 full bathrooms and many more wonderful features. The website photos are very accurate. I highly recommend going to the upper outdoor terrace to watch the sunset. There are 2 accessible terraces in the hotel. The one I'm referring to is further away from the breakfast area. Speaking of breakfast, that would be my one criticism of the hotel. The selection is very small and the service is poor. There is a daily happy hour with wine and a cheeseboard. Otherwise, there is no food service at the hotel. You can order food from the surrounding restaurants, through the hotel, for a $25 delivery charge. I think this is a great hotel especially for larger families. "
We stayed here 4 days and loved the location. Beautiful suite! So roomy and classic. Incredibly comfy beds! Close to the Wharf/Marina and so quiet. Great restaurants and Ghiradelli ice cream located outside in the building square. Don't miss the chocolate and ice cream. Waffle cones smelled devine. Incredible views off their 2nd floor patio/deck. 
"5 star resort. Beautiful rooms. We had a suite with 2 bedrooms on the second floor and a very nice terrace (room 226), must have been one of the best rooms. Great view. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Special thanks to Micheal (reception) who reserved every night another great restaurant and booked 2 unforgettable trips.Unfortunately we couldn't visit Alcatraz, this has nothing to do with the hotel but keep in mind that you have to reserve your tickets 2 months in advance.Breakfast is included, however it is very, very basic. Don't expected any eggs, waffles or pancakes. We crossed the street to have a nice breakfast and the kitchen is very well equipped so you could have breakfast on your terrace.You can do your laundry in the suite, a big plus when you are traveling as a family.Conclusion: great hotel, we had a wonderful stay !"
"We enjoyed a birthday celebration here last week. This is an opportunity to enjoy luxury in an historical setting. The 1895-vintage red brick warehouses of the Ghirardelli Chocolate Company, located at what is now Ghirardelli Square, have been converted into one, two and three bedroom luxury residences with red brick walls, high ceilings, hard wood floors, high-end appliances and furnishings. The residences either view the City or San Francisco Bay. Fairmont manages the property in its inimitable fashion with professional staffing and amenities that include a house car, complimentary continental breakfast and afternoon wine and cheese. This is San Francisco at its very best."
"Beautiful and sisvious apartments that had everything we needed for our stay. A full kitchen and laundry were a feature as well the lovely bathrooms, comfortable beds and ammenities. Concierge were very helpful also. The apartments were close enough to Fishermans Wharf to be able to walk to all the action but far enough away to be able to retire to some privacy and quietness of an evening. Of course an added bonus was being right next to the famous Ghiradelli Chocolates and the lovely little shops in Ghiradelli square. "
"As a fractional owner, we use the residences at Ghirardelli as a home away from home and love to host parties there. We just used one of our ""planned weeks"" to host two parties.....one a mini high school reunion and the other a 4th of July celebration. Because the reunion was a very special occasion, I enlisted the help of the staff and management at Ghirardelli. They recommended using the Carillon (gazebo) so my guests would be comfortable and could enjoy a sit-down dinner. They provided heaters, linens, set up and cleanup. Everyone we dealt with was amazing, providing an extremely high level of service just like at every visit. We requested a specific residence and they were able to accommodate us. My guests and I had a wonderful time. All were very impressed with the level of service as well as the property. A fabulous experience!!!"
We thoroughly enjoyed our one week stay here. Took our college age daughter for her first trip to San Francisco and were glad for the space and amenities. We enjoyed Mimosas on the rooftop patio each afternoon while soaking up the fabulous view of the bay. Continental breakfast each morning was a bonus. We would generally grab a plate and take it back to the room to enjoy in solitude. The surrounding restaurants are excellent and it's just a block to the cable car. Housekeeping staff was excellent as well as the concierge.
"Spacious condos. Security at doors coming and going. Love the location, quiet but close to everything. Breakfast buffet was different every day with multiple choices. Valet were especially helpful and friendly. Housekeeping staff was quick to respond to needs. The bay view cannot be beat!!"
Requested second floor apartments with balcony and fire pit 3months in advance but only 3rd and 4th floor available. Overall experience was great! Elevator smelled like rotten food. It was awful. Would likely book again but they cannot guarantee second floor apartments which is disappointing considering the cost of 2 apartments!
"We stayed here for 3 nights as we moved our son in to his apartment in the City. It was perfect- 2 bedrooms, kitchen, living room, housekeeping, continental breakfast and wine & cheese nightly. Staff was perfect and saw to our every needs. We booked through Inspirato (another review and highly recommended)."
"Stayed in a lovely condo here for 2 nights and really enjoyed it ! The breakfast buffet was a little strange, but all in all it did the trick ,very accommodating staff. Well placed for getting around.A very convenient location. Comfortable beds."
"I've been here 3 times in the last 6 years, and it is a joy. This is a set of historic buildings that have been renovated. Apparently they were factory buildings, and the current names reflect this. There are the Cocoa, Chocolate, Mustard, and Woolen Mill buildings, to name a few. The comfortable two-bedroom units I experienced give you lots of space, and though there's not a full kitchen, what is there is plenty for a small meal or to make take-out very comfortable! There's even a wine fridge. :) The views are of the bay and Alcatraz or Russian Hill. Ghirardelli Square has restaurants and quaint little shops that make this area a fun and darling little home base. A quick walk takes you to the Buena Vista Cafe (get an Irish coffee or don't go at all!), the wharf, and the Embarcadero. The Fairmont provides a lot of extras. There are complimentary computer rooms for checking email or printing something, a solid continental breakfast with coffee, juices, breads and pastries, fruits, cereals, and even a hot dish or two. It will easily tide you over until a late lunch when you're out and about. Also, there is a wine hour in the afternoons with small bites, like cheese and crackers, olives, nuts, and grapes. The house car is available on a first-come, first-served basis in a radius of a few miles, so you can get to that first museum or to a nearby restaurant for free (make sure you tip the driver, though!) And the service throughout the hotel is top-notch. It seems as though everyone there is knowledgeable about the city and wants to share that info with you. Have a great time!"
"This is an ideal location, close to Fisherman's Wharf, the trolley. The staff is very helpful and attentive. I have stayed here twice and love coming every time - the units are awesome! I wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the amenities."
This is really a great location but be aware it is partial ownership units which are rented out. Rooms are large and very well appointed but this is not your normal high end hotel. Service staff are excellent and will assist you in every way. Very close to Fishermans Wharf and all the fine restaurants that it has to offer. There is a limo which will take you and pick you up if you want to venture from the area. Room service is available from local restaurants and the units have full well appointed kitchens. Great for high end family vacation or multiple couples. If you want a full service hotel with bar and restaurant in the hotel this is not it. Pricy. 
"From the minute we arrived, we knew we were in for a treat. We were trying to figure out where to park our big SUV. The doorman came out and valet parked our car as he did for the duration of our stay. Coming from the East Coast, we arrived early before check in. We were happy to learn our unit was ready and they gave us the keys. The concierge gave us a 10 minute tour of the property then brought us to our unit where our luggage had already been delivered. We are a family of 5 and the unit we are in is perfect. Master bedroom with a king size bed and bathroom attached. Upstairs is also a king size bed with a full bathroom. In the living room is a couch that has the most comfortable pullout bed we have ever slept on. Downstairs off the kitchen there is also a half size bathroom. Every morning there is a complimentary breakfast served including hot breakfast sandwiches, fresh fruit, bagels, and excellent coffee. Every night there is complimentary wine and cheese served between 5:00-6:00. There is also a complimentary house car that will drive you anywhere within a 2 mile radius of the property. On the fourth day of our stay there was housekeeping. The location is perfect and easy to get to most attractions. The one fault we found in renting here was most units are rented Friday to Friday. We did work something out with the owner but did work something out with her so that we did not have to pay for the first Friday we were not here and rented as a single day the last Friday we were here."
"we needed a place to stay with my boys that wanted mom home made cooking . so we needed a cooking in facility, the rental route was a bit off for us , so we ended up picking this place.it was costly but we said lets go for it must be topping four seasons. So , first of all : we paid much too much for what we got! yes we did get two bed rooms with lovely balcony . the front desk is the kind that want to be four seasons hotels style with but touches of holiday inn. We reserved the unit for 12 pm. well, we got in by 1 pm , no room , and brush off type of reason. We are four in the unit , they left only two bottles of water only . with the kind of money they are charging one think that one bottle to each guest will be a given . I must admit that I don't know where they get guests to come and pay that type of rates and get so little of service . The "" complimentary"" wine and cheese reception at 5 pm was at best 2 stars. The hotel is for sure five stars level but service is less then three. On top of all of it my hubby had fallen while running and was in hospital I called the front desk guy Michael and asked to add few hours to check out time and he refused me!! He said we must leave by 1 pm. i was let down over all 3200 dollars for two nights with service of 69 dollars a night motel."
"This is a lovely property in an excellent location. It is better as a long term stay and is a condo style property with a fully functioning kitchenette. There is no restaurant associated with the facility so do not expect room service. It is in a square with excellent restaurants and views. They offer a driving service within a small radius on a first come first serve basis, however, the return pick up can be spotty and very unreliable. I must admit my review is based on my preference for more amenities."
"Family visit to a city that is electric and traditional. Our stay at Fairmont Garidelli was the cherry on top of the sundae. My family has stayed here many times and it feels like home. The location is perfect. The town car is very reliable for short hauls, say to nearby restaurants. Parking in this city is like winning the lottery, so this option is greatly appreciated. Lovely hotel, great service and views of the bay round out a pleasant experience. And if one of the best chocolate shops is next door, well there you have a family pleaser!"
"Excellent property with outstanding service and location. Clean, quiet and comfortable. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Relaxing and comfortable ambience. Beautiful views. Outside decks provide peaceful and relaxing place to gather around fire pit and enjoy view of Alcatraz and Piers."
Stayed for a week on my honeymoon...Standing in the kitchen looking at a view of Alcatraz which looked just like a painting. We had the best time and stay. We also can not wait to go back and would highly recomend
"Just got home after 5 nights at this amazing property. Beautiful rooms/ apartments and great staff. Marco, Alex, Michael and other staff couldn't do enough for us. Great location and loved the house car. Thanks for a great stay."
"We've stayed here twice now, and both visits were very enjoyable. The rooms are lovely, spacious and well-appointed. Full kitchens, great views, and quiet. A little hallway noise, but really not bad at all. Recommended!"
"As a family of five, we need space and have come to appreciate the comforts of home while traveling. We enjoyed seven nights at the Fairmont Heritage Place in a two bedroom suite. Overall the property is in excellent condition, we had some noticeable wear in our suite (headboard in master and an upholstered chair), but otherwise property looks great! Washer/Dryer were great for small loads and detergent pods were made available. The communal outdoor spaces were lovely and the complimentary continental breakfast and wine & cheese hour were bonuses. The property is walkable to Fisherman's Wharf and situated in a nice area. Don't hesitate to book!"
"I spent a lot of time researching hotels in San Fran before booking the Fairmont Heritage. It is the only hotel that can accommodate large families at a decent price in the city. We booked a 3 bedroom and I was very happy with the amount of space provided. Each bedroom had its on bathroom and the square footage was excellent. The location of this hotel is also excellent you are right in Ghiradelli square which means you are close to the pier and waterfront. The Concierge service was absolutely fantastic it surpassed any 5 star hotel or resort I have ever stayed at. Michael was attentive and extremely helpful and I cannot say enough wonderful things about the service he provided. Drawbacks to this property: Despite being very luxurious there is no room service on site. There is no bar or restaurant on site. Some of the furniture was worn. The bed in the master suite had torn leather on the head board and foot boards. The bathroom in the middle bedroom had a tub and glass doors that had a dangerous design. They open in therefore you can't turn the water on without getting in the shower first, which puts kids and adults quite frankly at risk to burn themselves or freeze themselves. The tub is also really high and the door is really difficult to squeeze past. Positives: Great location, excellent space/square footage, amazing concierge service, hotel car for guest use when available. Complimentary breakfast included which was very nice. Suggestions: The resort offers turn down service which one would expect at this price point, but no chocolates on the pillows? You are in Ghiradelli square seems like a no brainer to me. The shower really needs to be addressed it is a hazard."
"If you're traveling for pleasure or have business in the marina/wharf area, this is hands down the best hotel. I stayed a week and could have stayed forever. The staff were extraordinary and very accommodating to our needs. The rooms and communal areas were modern, clean, and very well appointed. The bed was, well, let's just say I'll never get a better nights sleep. A truly five star experience I'll never forget. "
"Our family stayed at this classy property for a week over our daughters' spring break. We had such a lovely time being close/walking distance to easy public transit and gorgeous San Fran views! We used the residence's car and driver a couple times and it was simple to do so, although it was quite popular and is first come, first served, thus not a guaranteed ride. Breakfast was ample and delicious. Thank you for a great stay, excited to return."
"We recently stayed at this location for a vacation and visit to Google and Apple for my son's future internship opportunities. We chose the Fairmont because of location to Ghirardelli Square, Fisherman's Wharf, and the Golden Gate Bridge. The location was perfect. The hotel on the other hand was a different story. The staff was awesome and brought us to our large room upon check in. They brought us to our room and gave us a tour. The room was very amazing and nicely decorated, however the room was poorly maintained. There was mold around the ktichen sink, mold all over the shower floor, and around the bathtubs. Yuck. The king headboard was falling apart and the polyester falling off. The window coverings were in shams and were falling apart and ridiculous to try to open. The window coverings were just disgusting and belonged in a 1 star, hourly motel. The noise levels from the rooms above was extremely excessive. I live in a high rise and have never experienced such loud noises and continuous walking throughout the night. While the location and the room layout were awesome, the lack of care shown on maintaining this hotel were less than desirable. I would definitely not stay here again. It's just not maintained enough to be a quality hotel and the noise levels in the evening was ridiculous. To think I paid over $3000 for only four nights stay and I couldn't get out of the room fast enough. "
Really great suites. We got the two bedroom. Awesome kitchenette and family room. Great tv's in every room with surround sound. View of San Francisco Bay and Alcatraz from the room on Ghirardelli Square with lots of nearby restaurants and shops. 
"One of the best stay at San Francisco. We transferred from other hotel after our disappointing stay. Hotel Fairmont Heritage Place treat like we are the part of hotel and we feel so much happy to get such a great hospitality room was clean, location is just near to the beach where we can walk. Staff go beyond the limits to help. Superb eco friendly hotel. We recommend highly to this hotel..."
"We had expected a modest suite when we booked this hotel. Wow, were we wrong. When we arrived we were informed that we had been upgraded, just because. When we arrived at our ""suite"", we instead found ourselves in an amazing 2 bedroom apartment. This apartment had a full kitchen, dining room table with seating for 6, a living room connected, open floor plan, to the kitchen/dining area. There was a half-bath just off of this area. In the hall there was a closet with a stacking washer/dryer. Down the hall, around the corner, and to the end, were to the bedrooms. The master had a full bathroom, deep tub and shower. The other bedroom had a full bath with a large shower stall. The views were amazing. Not only did we look down onto Ghiradelli Square, we also could see both the Golden Gate and Bay bridges, as well as Alcatraz and the mountains beyond. While we didn't have a chance to partake in the wine and cheese social hour in the evening, both mornings we enjoyed a generous, included, ""continental"" breakfast. I quote that because the offerings were more than bagels and cereal. No one will starve after having breakfast here. There staff was more than amazing. There was some confusion as to our check out time, so our key cards were deactivated too early. We happened to be in the elevator with a manager when we found this out. He accompanied us to our suite to make sure we could get into it, and, when I went back downstairs to have our cards reactivated, I met the manager on his way up with new cards so, his words, we wouldn't feel trapped in our suite. I would most assuredly stay here again."
"Stayed there for two nights and were very pleased.Room service food was very good, the hospitality was great, the hotel views were very nice.Really liked the area and the fact that we could walk to the beach straight from the hotel.Room was very spacious and The bed was comfortable."
"Traveling as a group of 5 people and 3 dogs can be daunting (even if the dogs are small), so I wasn't sure what to expect when we checked in to the Fairmont Heritage Place, Ghirardelli Square. Built in 1893 by the sons of Domingo Ghiradelli for their growing chocolate business, the building has since been transformed in to a lovely hotel with private residences. We had reserved the three bedroom/three bathroom residence. It did not disappoint. The kitchen was outfitted with a sub zero drawer style fridge and freezer, dishwasher and plenty of pots a pans for cooking. There was also a coffee pot and wine fridge. Each bedroom had its own en suite bathroom, which allowed for plenty of privacy. The suite also included a washer and dryer and free WiFi..The hotel is very dog friendly and we passed several dogs and owners on our way in and out of our suite. A small breakfast is served daily (included in the room price), as well as wine and cheese in the evening. This hotel is perfect for families and dog owners alike. The proximity to the waterfront was perfect, with walking/bike trails practically at our doorstep. This makes it perfect for dog owners!The only issue we encountered during our stay was being awaken at all hours of the night with people (and children) coming, going and running above us. We never complained to the front desk so I'm not sure how it would have been handled.Would I stay at this hotel again - in a heart beat.Rooms: Spacious with great amenitiesService: ExcellentLocation: Perfect"
"Cannot say enough. The hotel was outstanding. From location and car service to take you anywhere in the neighborhood to turndown service with abundance of ghirardelli chocolates, to wine and cheese hour, fire pits on balconies, and just beautifully decorated rooms with rustic furniture and ultramodern amenities, the hotel is a gem. All rooms are suites.It has the almost magical feel of old chocolate factory and staff is super helpful, especially concierge and driver. The views are stunning.Just a pleasure.Recommend for families and couples and pretty much everyone."
"By way of background, we travel with our three kids every month of the year - domestically and internationally. We are in hotels all the time and are always looking for family-friendly properties.Frankly, we didn't even know the Fairmont at Ghiradelli was a hotel. It's essentially a timeshare of one, two and three bedroom properties that is run as a hotel/timeshare. It's in the most amazingly perfect location - in Ghiradelli Square, which isn't only ideal, but it's connected to family-friendly places and treats.Additionally, it's only a block from Gary Danko so if you want great food, walk one block. It's also at one far end of the San Francisco waterfront - and you can make an entire day from walking from your hotel until you are near the bay bridge (four or five miles?) and then take a Uber or cab back. The rooms are all set up with a small kitchen and family room, as well as one, two or three bedrooms. They also have a house car that can drive you to nearby locations. The facilities themselves are appointed quite well - clean, contemporary and comfortable. Our family loves this annual visit to San Francisco and can't wait to get back - there is so much to do. Trust me - you will not be disappointed. They are opening an onsite restaurant with a famous chef at the end of this month which will only enhance the experience."
"San Fran is usually one of those cities you end up having to bite the bullet and pay full price for, especially during a busy week like it was for the Super Bowl. I don't know if I just got lucky or what, but I booked my Hotel through hoprocket.com and couldn't say no to the saving at the Fairmont Heritage Place. It's not a cheap hotel, and let me say you get what you pay for, but I was able to get a room during super bowl week for $273 off a night and I couldn't turn that down! The hotel is amazing, with beautiful views of the city and we spent many afternoons before hitting the city, sitting by the outdoor fire drinking wine in the beautiful February weather! In all, it was worth spending a little extra cash when I found a deal like that on hoprocket.com"
"Perfect in every way. The staff, the room, the location---Everything was wonderful. I would definitely recommend splurging on a bay view room as it offered stunning views. The location was a short walk to Fisherman's Wharf and lots of restaurants. I had such a great experience and will definitely stay again when in San Francisco."
"I'm a long term Fairmont Presidents Club Member and have stayed at Fairmonts around the world,whilst the location is terrific the cost is nearly out or is out of reach for families , I booked a stay 4 days pay for 3 deal but black out dates prevented this from eventuating, I had 3 rooms for 6 nights at Fairmont Vancouver and a two bedroom apartment at the 5 star Sunpeaks Grand for 10 nights for less than 4 nights at Ghirardelli Square , too expensive for us to visit again I'm afraid"
"We stayed in a one bedroom apartment on the 1st floor overlooking Ghiradelli square. There was a large balcony and Alcatraz could be seen between the buildings opposite.The apartments were really high quality. Loved the coffee machine, wine cooler, high grade TV and speakers. The only disappointment was that there was no bath only a large shower. It is nice to soak in the tub after a long day walking and sightseeing. The square was not noisy at night although busy in the day, but it was nice to sit on the private terrace or on the hotel terraces at complimentary cheese and wine hour and people watch. There are some nice shops in the square for chocolate, wine tasting and other boutique items. There is a convenience store across the road from the front entrance for essential groceries.The help-yourself continental breakfast was perfectly OK, and you can take coffee to go.There was ongoing construction in the square but it did not disturb us.We didn't use the hotel car, as there are a lot of places to eat and visit within walking distance, although avoid the tacky tourist section of Fishermans Wharf. The trolley car station is a short distance away and although you have to queue, it will take you all the way to Union square.We only engaged with the reception staff and doormen, all were perfectly courteous and helpful. Highly recommended as a great base to visit SF, I would definitely book to stay here again."
"Our visit to the Fairmont Heritage Place, Ghiradelli Square on December 31, 2016 was extremely disappointing. Service was exceptionally terrible and it was just one bad experience after another. We had called ahead to request an early check-in (2pm) and were told that it shouldn't be a problem. I called again the morning of (10am) and they said someone had just checked out but they would have them service our room immediately and they would call us when the room would be ready. Long story short, we didn't get to check-in to our room until AFTER the normal check-in time of 4pm. They also couldn't find our phone number (which we provided 3 times) so they never ended up calling us. We had requested 2 roll away beds and told them which rooms to put them in. The beds turned out to be blow up beds (which 1 deflated in the middle of the night) and they didn't set them up in the right rooms. The faux leather headboard in the Master bedroom was worn out. One of the bathroom shower doors only opened half way. We asked the valet for an auxiliary cord for the sound system and he said, ""We run out of those really quickly. I would recommend you call a friend and ask them to bring one with you."" We woke up the next morning to a leaky kitchen sink and water had covered the entire counter. We spent over 10 minutes on hold when we were trying to call a valet to help us with our things. We finally gave up and hauled everything downstairs to check out. At checkout, I noticed they had billed us twice for parking -- which was easily recognizable but the receptionist didn't take 30 seconds to review the charges.The hotel was clearly understaffed. The staff was frazzled, unapologetic, and acted annoyed when you requested something. At first I thought we weren't being treated well because we booked through hotels.com but the lobby was filled with angry customers the morning we were checking out. I'm extremely disappointed in the quality of service and condition of the property for $2,000/night room. I have loved staying at Fairmont properties in the past but I'll think twice before I book again.. I submitted my feedback to the hotel 2 weeks ago and never received a response."
"A great hotel with a wonderful location. The rooms are quite fantastic with lots of room and light. The staff were excellent and couldn't do enough for you, a free car is available to drop and collect within a few mile radius which is enough to take you to most tourist places.Free breakfast was enough for all and varied a little each day.Free cheese and wine each day at 5pm to mix and mingle or just sit near the fir. pit and chat away.Open the back door and your into a great courtyard with stuff to do and eat."
"Stayed Sept 2015 with another couple, which worked really well. We each had large bedroom with full size bathroom. Very large dining table area and TV lounge room. Nice views over G Square. Easy walk to Cable Car stop and Wharf area. Breakfast OK but not 5 star. In room washing machine and dryer very handy. Thoroughly enjoyed San Fran, even tho the wind blows in September. "
"Just spent three nights in a two bedroom bay view room. The staff was great, and the hotel car was terrific. The rooms are spacious, but the bathrooms are so-so. The water pressure was erratic and they only had single vanities. The location is terrific if you are touring with children. I gave four stars because I don't think the price point and quality match. A good choice, but not a good value."
"My family and I stayed in San Francisco for a couple of nights at the beginning of my summer break. When we first stepped into our 3-room suite we were absolutely wowed at the gorgeous kitchen that welcomed us so warmly into our stay. Not only is the kitchen beautiful and spacious, it is also fully equipped so you can always cook up a meal and enjoy it at the expansive dining table close to the kitchen. The hotel is at a super convenient location; when you walk downstairs you find yourself instantly at Ghirardelli Square; I once casually walked downstairs to grab myself a cup of hot cocoa and a chocolate-coated strawberry. Beds were very comfortable and the bedrooms were adorned with San Francisco themed decor; bathrooms came with spacious showers and were incredibly clean. Even though this place is in a touristy location (it's right by Fisherman's Wharf), I think it's worth staying here; we loved it so much that we decided to lengthen our initial two day stay and cancel some of our future plans. "
"We've stayed here before and loved it. It truly can be a luxury property; nice big rooms, generally good sound proofing, nice breakfast (no room service) but no lattes.However.We were placed in the ""Mustard"" wing---large rooms with two bedrooms with one of the bedrooms upstairs in a loft. Great views of the Bay, overlooking Aquatic Park, nice and quiet---kitchen, two and half baths, living room, gas fireplace. Nice room.at 6:43 am on a Friday, we were awakened by a rotohammer impact drill's vibration thrumming away through the brick and steel superstructure. Turns out that on the first floor of the Mustard Bldg---the second part of the hotel, where we were located---contractors for Ghiradelli Square are installing---I think---a bakery. And despite having a noise agreement with the hotel, the construction crew, like crews anywhere, just went to work. at 6:43 am. With impact rotohammer tools. Yes, the hotel staff jumped in to get them to quiet down. Yep, we were on the 3rd floor, so I can only imagine the people on the 2nd floor, below us and directly above the vibrating racket had it worse.But still.It was really disappointing. So---if you are looking at this otherwise wonderful property for a stay insist on 1) A room NOT over the construction (be realistic; it doesn't matter if the hotel asks the crew not to make noise; obviously they've been doing that it happened anyway; so it's going to happen again). This means a room NOT in the Mustard Wing and 2) a room on the Bay side of the main building overlooking the San Francisco Bay.We'll probably be back sometime; but I'll make darn sure the construction has been put to bed before we do.:("
"It's definitely a wonderful property - location is perfect, in the middle of things without being in the middle of things, beautiful rooms, comfy beds. Awesome stay, wished it was longer! I know where I want to return to when I have the time and opportunity!"
"These aren't rooms, these are five-star multi-million dollar condos. I switched from two little adjoining rooms at the Westin (that I might add were really beat up) to an immaculate 1200 square foot two bedroom unit and it actually saved me money. Daughter didn't want to go home. Despite location inside Ghirardelli Square it is very quiet (really, it IS the Square. Most of the buildings were apparently converted)They have an evening wine reception and continental breakfast, a nice touch."
"The view from our suite was amazing - across to Alcatraz. The location was excellent - one block from Fishermen's Wharf, the tram and the hop-on-hop-off bus. The hotel does not have a restaurant or bar but does serve a good breakfast. The suite has a fully equipped kitchen, lounge and even washing machine and dryer."
"It seems like all of the rooms here are suites (1BD or 2 BD) - and they are really nice! They are really well-set up with lots of high-end amenities including kitchens with dishes, pots, pans, and even a wine fridge. There is a free continental breakfast that is far better than just cold cereal - there were breakfast sandwiches, bagels, oatmeal, fresh fruit, etc. My room had a really nice view of the water, and I saw that a bunch of rooms had patios that overlooked Ghirardelli and some had fire pits. Speaking of fire pits, there were a bunch of those and other places to sit and relax all over the hotel. One downside is there does not seem to be an on-site hotel or room service, but since the location is right in Ghirardelli Square, there are really close restaurants right in the plaza. Speaking of location, this hotel is not located in Union Square or Downtown like a lot of other hotels in the city, but there is still a lot to do in this area - especially for tourists who want to access Fisherman's Wharf and Alcatraz, etc. Personally, I would prefer this location if you have a car. I have no complaints and would definitely recommend it for a nice stay in San Francisco!"
Ghirardelli square is as delicious as you would expect. I had the sundae which was so rich and tasty! This is a must in San Francisco...Just bring a warm sweater as it gets cold by the water! I was so full from dinner that sharing this still left us extra.
"Excelllent lodging and great setup with sitting room, kitchen, laundry, etc. plus hotel is well located for getting to everything you want to do and see in San Francisco and the Bay Area. Staff is helpful, and valet services staff is really lovely. And there's a nice, basic breakfast set up each morning. very reasonable cost for all the comfort and convenience."
"Second time here, and we will be back for sure! Rooms are so perfectly laid out, and beds are so incredibly comfortable. The only problem we had was water pressure in the shower. Great location near Ghiradelli square, and the beautiful water front. Very well maintained location with great staff! Also the house car can take you just about anywhere with little notice. Love this place so much, I may consider becoming an owner."
"To start with the location of this hotel is perfect. It is close to most of the attraction and There is a free house car to take you to places that are 2 miles away from the hotel which was an excellent service. We had the two bed room apartment which was very spacious and has every thing we needed. The staff are super helpful, extremely friendly and made our stay more pleasant. the only negative thing about this hotel is the fact that there is no in room dining in kthe hotel but they offer to bring you food from 2 restaurants and a pub near by with an extra charge. The choices are limited and the restaurants close at 10:00 pm, also the valet parking is very expensive but this is like any where else in San Francisco.We loved this hotel and it will be our first choice for our next visit to San Francisco."
"Brand spanking new hotel. Everything is new and exquisitely decorated. One of the best in San Francisco as it's tough to find a luxurious AND new hotel in the city. Only knock would be location. North Beach is great as a local (I lived here for two years) but not so great as a tourist though one may be interested in Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39 (I would stay away). You are walking distance to great shopping in the Marina and the heart of North Beach which are both great. Overall, would love to come back."
"We stayed here in a 2BR suite. It's a great place for families. Most of the building are owners/fractional owners and the building is well-maintained. not a ton of in and out traffic. Location is great within 5 minutes from Lombard cable car 10 minute walk from Fisherman's Wharf...15 minutes from Pier 39, 40 minute from Exploratorium (amazing children museum). Easy access to rest of city either by car, uber or taxi. Also above Ghirardelli Square which has easy stores to go for ice cream, wine tasting etc.Full kitchens that can be stocked before arriving. When arriving with early mornings from east coast jetlag makes it easy to make breakfast. Lounge in hotel also has a nice continental breakfast (bagels, fruit, oatmeal, pastries, coffee). Lounges open all day with some toys and outdoor terrace overlooking square.Staff was very helpful and friendly. We'd stay here again for sure."
Stayed here for 3 nights for the Ghirardelli chocolate festival. Beautiful hotel and the staff extremely friendly. Lovely rooftop and beautiful views of the bay. Would definitely stay again. Buffet style breakfast with a good selection.
"I was looking for a luxury hotel to spend 5 wonderful days with my family in San Francisco. Convinced by the excellent reviews on TripAdvisor, I booked at The Fairmont Heritage.This Hotel has a very impressive location, it overlooks Ghirardelli Square, maybe the position is not exactly strategic, but it allows beautiful walks along the piers.The room was cosy, charming and well-equipped, complete with wifi, a fireplace, kitchen, dishwasher, washing machine, dryer. Unfortunately, the list of positives is not longer. In fact, my overall experience was pretty disappointing.Breakfast in the morning was the worst. Their idea is to make it self serviced but the results are disastrous.You arrive to an empty room with few naked tables. There’s literally none there, ever.You take a napkin, some forks and cups and set your table (if you manage to find one clean, as there aren’t many).The food offered is very far from being a ""deluxe continental"" as written on their website. The choice of everything was extremely poor, there was no staff that could satisfy any request, there was no hot items like eggs or bacon or espresso... I asked if it was possible to have some scrambled eggs the next morning but they told me to go to the restaurant across the square!One day, returning to the room in the afternoon, I found that someone had left on the table a juice paper cup. Since it was not clear whose that juice was and I was worried that someone could have entered my room while I was away, I mentioned the fact to the receptionist who found nothing better to say than asking me: “have you tasted it? In any case don’t worry, you can throw it away!”Before arriving in S Francisco, we had asked the concierge to arrange a one day guided tour to Muir Woods and Sausalito and a boat ride back.The driver never spoke, he didn’t describe anything on the way, he just greet us and remained in the car. Moreover we had paid for the ferry tickets in advance, the concierge was supposed to give them to us that day. He didn’t do so. As a result we had to queue to buy again the tickets (they have been refunded at check-out).The hotel has not restaurants, you can order from nearby restaurants but you must pay $ 25 extra for the in room dining.I can’t understand how this hotel may appear in the list of 5-star hotels among the Ritz Carlton, the saitn Regis etc. where at a similar price you have services of a totally different level."
Let me start for the bad news for once. The breakfast is not up to standard for a Hotel of this standing. The selection is limited but decent quality so that is not an issue but there is very limited place to sit down. Yes we silly Europeans want to sit down when we eat. Hard to imagine for some Americans but hey that is what we expect.Second we had an apartment facing the sea and Alcatraz offering great view. Unfortunately the commercial centre below does offer quite some noise till late in the evening so take that into account.The location is great with easy access to all areas of SF. The view on Alcatraz and the sea was great. The duplex size is what I expected while the sleeping room itself was a little small but with great matrasses and bed to sleep. We didn't use the big kitchen but if you want to cook yourself it offers all you need. The renovations done keep the industrial feel but with a lot of cosiness added still giving a real authentic touch which we liked a lot. Service is superb. To give you an example. The hotel offers bikes which we reserved. Unfortunately the bikes were not all functional at our timing so they proposed to rent in the nearby bike rental shop and pay us back. Thank you well appreciated and showing you truly care about guest experience.Further all personnel was always helpful in providing guidance to discover SF.We opted for the valley parking which in fact is not necessary. Sufficient parking very close by. Even in the Ghirardelli centre. The hotel offers a free shuttle service that takes you to a lot of corners of SF to start from which was very convenient.They have a nice terrace with fire where we spend a cosy evening with friend sipping out a bottle of wine that we brought along from a wine shop.This hotel is a superb place to start from to discover SF. If it was not for the breakfast I would have given it 5 stars. Don't worry too much about that. You will still have more than a decent breakfast.Would I come back to the hotel probably not because I would like to see what other hotels have to offer in SF but I would certainly recommend the place for your stay Oh I forget to mention the WIFI. A good connection was available so no internet stress was measured.
"Had a perfect stay at the Fairmont Heritage Place! The location is unbeatable being located right in Ghirardelli Square. There are two balconies to relax on, one RIGHT under the famous illuminated sign. Perfect for breakfast or sunset - one of my new favorite spots! Breakfast is served each and every morning along with a free wine + cheese tasting from 5-6. Only down side is no spa, but you can have any service done in room (not cheap of course). Our room (more like an apartment) had two full bedrooms with baths, living room, kitchen and even laundry. You for sure get what you paid for (which is FAR from cheap). Turn down service also every night. Be sure to take advantage of the house car that picks up and drops off whenever.Will hopefully try to be back soon!! "
"More of a condo than hotel this is a great destination in sf. Close to fishermans wharf and the Golden Gate Bridge, this is a luxury residence style hotel. We had a 2 bedroom condo with full kitchen and sitting area. Great place to relax and enjoy a great city. "
really a residence or castle guest pampered to the max allfurnitire best the world delivers the views are spectacular and the people are like in a movie nowonder hotel was filmed in the big sister so much background mixed with modern design not cheap wanna be if you look for the best in the world-youve found it here
"We arrived very late at night after an exhausting journey and couldn't have been better looked after or made more comfortable. The hotel is situated very close to the Harbourside attractions of San Francisco- perfect for walking to the Harbour Bridge or catching any of the ferries that run in the Bay. A big hit was having Alcatraz visible from our suite. The breakfast was adequate although there are plenty of great places to eat nearby. The rooms were quiet, well appointed and away from the hubbub of Heritage Place. It was a great base for our exploration of the city."
"I wish I could give a rating of 6, we found the Fairmont Heritage Place to be that good! This hotel was not cheap, but it was sooooo worth it! Our family of four (two teenagers) travelled through the US for four weeks and SF was our last stop. We had endured several hotels where the four of us shared a single hotel room so it was such a refreshing change to be shown into our Fairmont Heritage apartment and see a large lounge / dining room, kitchen, two bedroom, two bathrooms, plus washing machine and dryer! Three and a bit weeks into our holiday it was pure gold! The included continental breakfast was very nice, as was the afternoon complementary wine and cheese hour. Complimentary bicycles were a nice surprise, as was a complimentary car service, super fast complimentary Wi-Fi, and the outdoor lounge areas complete with deck chairs, lounge chairs and cosy fire pits. The location (Ghirardelli Square) is within a short walk of Fisherman's Wharf and we had magnificent views across SF Bay to Alcatraz and Sausalito. To top it off all staff were extremely courteous and helpful. This place truly has everything. If you can afford the extra cost it is well worth it, and if you convert the cost to dollars per foot you really do get good value for your money."
"We travelled as a family with 3 adults and 2 children and had a great stay at this hotel. Most of the rooms are suites with oven, microwave and fridge so it is great for families. We stayed in a two bedroom suite which was well appointed and nice. Very comfortable. Their out door deck is really nice. The location was also really good. You can easily walk to a lot of the attractions and there are plenty of restaurants nearby. Their staff is very helpful. Highly recommended!"
"Our family of six loved this hotel. Terrific location, excellent amenities, and super-helpful and friendly staff made this a perfect choice. The hotel car and loaner bicycles were added pluses for us. A special shout-out to Cara for making us all feel at home right away!"
"This place is perfectly nice, clean, etc., but it feels a little strange. Since there are residents it feels more like an extended stay kind of location. The service was excellent and Ghirardelli Square is cool, but the atmosphere is just amiss. Also, there are so many kids at the location. It blew my mind. The walls are also very thin. "
Spacious apartment with a fully equiped kitchen. It's right in the heart of San Francisco. The beds are particularly comfortable. I also loved the fact that it's in Ghirardelli Square where you can go to sit around.
This hotel is perfectly located near the beach and walking distance every where. The property was lovely offering all the comforts of home with the luxury of hotel amenities. The convenience of the shops and resturants of Ghirardelli Square were an added plus. The butlers are great!
"This is is really well located accommodation in the Fishermans Wharf area of San Francisco.However I'm not sure that I would class it as a hotel, it's more of a managed apartment building.The apartments are large, well equipped and decorated to a high standard, but many of the normal five star hotel facilities are missing. There is no on site catering (with the exception of a very basic, mainly cold buffet breakfast) or restaurant. No bar facilities, no pool.Please don't let this detract from what is a really good property, but don't expect a 5 star hotel experience - expect a high class, self contained apartment."
"Our family group of 10 recently spent 4 days in San Francisco. Since we had stayed at the Fairmont heritage and loved it so much, we thought we would give it another go. We were not disappointed. Still the same fantastic place to go back to at the end of a great day in San Francisco. Staff is beyond helpful. Residences are great, we had a 3 bed and 2 bed right beside each other, which was great for socializing in the evening. Breakfast was really a nice plus. If I had to make a complaint it would have to be about the pastries that they serve in the breakfast buffet. They are not the freshest. Maybe sourcing those from somewhere else would be a thought. But there are enough other things on the buffet to fill most stomachs for an activity filled day. The car was available for everything that we required with out any problems. That's a great perk too.Loved it, would stay again!"
"Stayed at this hotel from April 12 to 25, 2015. Great experience. We have always loved San Francisco, and this residence made the vacation a couple of notches better. Most of the staff, were wonderful - quick to respond to our every need."
"This is a cool hotel located in a renovated brick industrial building that was part of the original Ghirardelli Square complex. Our suite was spacious, modern with good views and plenty of natural light. The gym is small but perfectly adequate. A great breakfast is served in the lounge in the morning. The staff were very friendly.Being next to Ghirardelli Square however meant our rooms could be noisy. Also, our room was located above the private hotel patio. On Saturday night some guests were there until 3 in the morning chatting and laughing which woke me up.The location of the hotel is a bit awkward. It is near Pier 39, but for almost anything else you need to take a taxi as the public transit is very limited. There is hotel car but I was never able to use it. I later discovered that sometimes it is unavailable when there are not sufficient staff on duty."
"I stayed here for business and family vacation mixed. It was quiet and relaxing for the business part, and right in a great location to walk to many things + unforgettable views. As for the family vacation portion of the trip, we completely enjoyed the daily breakfasts included, the fantastic decks overlooking the bay and Alcatraz, the walks to the Warf for dinner and entertainment in the evenings and of course the great outdoor fireplaces. Oh, forgot the smell of chocolate emanating from nearby Ghiradelli. Despite being close to one of the city's most famous tourist attractions, Fisherman's Warf, and not liking that very touristy type of thing, this location was just perfect. The hotel had friendly service and very good quality generally in everything they did. I can't wait to go back, and I rarely go back to the same place twice!"
"We brought the entire family and had all three of the three bedroom residences. They were so comfortable and well furnished. Plenty of room for visiting and relaxing.The service from the moment I booked was superb. The staff, Cara, Anna, and every person we came in contact with was professional, and very concerned about making our stay wonderful. Thank you for the anniversary gift of champagne and chocolates! The whole family loved the property."
These apartments are just incredible. So homely and everything you would normally need at home right in the heart of San Francisco. The reception staff are some of the most polite and lovely people I've ever came across. We stayed in the 2 bedroom apartment and it was great! Lovely big balcony looking over the square and a shop close enough to the apartments to get groceries. Can't recommend it enough. We had been touring various states and stayed in 5/6 hotels before San Francisco so it was brilliant feeling at home and not living in a hotel. So much space to relax as well that you could have your own space unlike hotels. 
"This hotel is perhaps the best we've ever stayed in. Our beautiful 2 bedroom apartment was overlooking Alcatraz and had a beautiful outdoor deck area with a gas fire pit. A fully stocked and gorgeous kitchen, 2 luxury bathrooms, wonderfully comfortable beds and relaxing living area made us feel like we were really on holidays.The staff here are unbelievable! Our housekeeper did an amazing job and actually wrote little notes to us daily thanking us for our tip and wishing us a wonderful holiday- what an amazing lady (I think from memory her name was Julie?). The front desk staff were wonderful. Providing our children with soft toys, Disney back packs full of treats, answering all our questions and just generally being welcoming and lovely. They definitely make you feel as though you're in a 5 star hotel. The location is terrific, Ghirardelli Square is lovely (heaven for ice cream and chocolate lovers such as me), with wonderful views and within walking distance to all that Fisherman's Wharf has to offer.Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our time here and would love to come back if we're ever back in San Francisco. Thank you to all staff members who do their job with the utmost professionalism, friendliness and pride and who helped make our stay do wonderful!"
"We stayed at this wonderful property after driving from Los Angeles. It is perfectly positioned for any length visit to San Francisco being close to Fishermans Wharf, but far enough away from the crowds, and a block or so away from the Cable Car turnaround. There are also many good restaurants and cafes within a very short distance.The one bedroom apartment was spacious with an open kitchen which had cooking facilities, a fridge, freezer and dishwasher. The living room was very comfortable and included a gas fireplace, a very nice touch. The bedroom was large enough to accommodate our 3 large suitcases and still feel roomy. The bed was perfect. Best of all there was a washer and dryer. After driving for a week, it was really nice to be able to launder some clothes ad we we boarding a cruise ship when we left San Francisco.The hotel also has many private sitting areas inside and out (the outdoor areas had fire pits) where views of the Bay could be enjoyed.Another nice touch was the option of having a complimentary hotel car transfer within 2 miles of the hotel.When we return to San Francisco, the Fairmont Heritage Place will definitely be our preferred hotel."
"Could not complain as the room and hotel suited our style of trip. 2 BR Bay view room was perfect and we could use the back exit down stairs to get in and out of hotel with minimum fuss. Hotel guest car was very convenient but expect delays if hotel is very busy.For a family of 4 on the road the room and hotel was very good with lots of eating options in walking distance. Past reviews I had read before booking worried me about service, and I could see that some (not all) staff were happy to do the bare minimum, therefore if you are happy looking after yourself as well as service its the perfect location and place."
"I would recommend this hotel. I have stayed in San Fran twice. The first time I stayed by myself at the Mandarin. It was nice - very nice. But the second time, it was the entire family and not just me. So as I was weighing the cost of two rooms at the Mandrin vs the Ghiradelli, I decided to go with the Ghiradelli. I thought it was the right choice and if you are going as a family I recommend it. We had a 2 bdrm suite and it was very nice. It was large - like an apartment. I have stayed at several hotels with kitchens - some of them very nice hotels - but this was by far the best hotel kitchen. The staff was nice. The free breakfast was nice. The wine and cheese hour was pleasant. You could get a glass of wine and sit by one of the outdoor firepits. My recommendation - if you stay here, pay extra for a view. My thinking is always who cares what the view is, you won't be there during viewing hours. But, the street view comes with street noise. The windows did a good job blocking the noise - it wasn't a hotel problem - but the streets of San Fran can be noisy. My second recommendation - try to get a top floor if you can. We heard noise from above, but only one night. Overall, this is about as good as it gets. The rooms are worth it if you are like us and always end up with two hotel rooms anyway. Hey if you are looking for hotels in San Fran, I would also say that the greenhills wine tour was awesome and so was alcatraz (get tickets to alcatraz at least a month ahead)."
"We stayed in a 3-bedroom city view unit at the Fairmont for two nights just before Christmas, and could not have asked for a better experience! The location of this hotel perfect, adjacent to Ghiradelli Square (Christmas tree and decor were fantastic) and directly across from the Wharf. The complimentary house car (an SUV, perfect for our group of four) was an added bonus--quickly shuttling us in style to and from everywhere else in the City that we wanted to see.The service at the Fairmont was top notch all around, from check-in through check-out. The unit itself was even better than expected--outstanding furnishings, fixtures, and electronics, including an excellent high-end surround sound system. While there was so much to do in so little time during our visit to San Francisco, we would have all been happy to have more time at the hotel!I will definitely be back to this hotel my next time in San Francisco."
"My extended family and I stayed at the Fairmont for a weekend in mid March. We had a 2 bedroom bay view unit, as well as a 3 bedroom city view. Both units were spacious and comfortable. The bathrooms were large and had wonderful, high quality Le Labo Rose 31 toiletries. On our first night, we ordered in room dining which is picked up from one of 3 restaurants in the area and delivered to the room by one of the Fairmont butlers. The food we ordered was delicious (from the Pub)and was delivered quickly. We enjoyed the outdoor terrace in the evenings...sitting by the fire, drinking Ghiradelli hot chocolate and watching the bay....it doesn't get much better than that! The hotel itself is lovely, the units are impressive and the complimentary breakfast is appreciated, but what really makes this hotel stand out is the service. From the minute we pulled up, everyone from the doorman, to the concierge, the butlers and all staff we met were friendly and extremely helpful. The house car service was also wonderful for getting our group to dinner reservations on time!We will definitely return to the Fairmont!"
"I stayed here for one night with my girlfriend before heading up to Napa Valley for a weekend. This is a nice property that is right in Fisherman's Wharf and has great restaurants adjacent. The one bedroom suite was very nice and comfortable bed. The shower was great. We went to the wine reception in the evening and it was nice. Found the breakfast they offered lacking. One of the best things about this hotel is that it is right on the bay and you get great views of the golden gate bridge, alcatraz, and the bay bridge. Walking across the street at sunset and sunrise and sitting on the beach of the bay is super nice."
"The two bedroom 'apartment' they gave us was enormous and very beautiful. The amenities provided were way more than comprehensive. The view from our patio was breathtaking. The location of the property makes it probably the best in the city. So why mixed feelings? Well basically this is a time share facility disguised as a 'hotel'. For me, I missed the 'hotel' aspects which we had enjoyed so much at the wonderful Plaza in New York which we had left to come here. We saw almost no staff. There is no real hub or centre to this property. No restaurant. No bar. Nowhere really to have breakfast or lunch or dinner. No real room service of any kind. And for me, the final straw - there is a washing machine and tumble drier in the room. I openly admit that I am the ultimate 'snob' and would ever knowingly choose a 'self catering' property for any stay of any kind. But that's just what this felt like! A self catering apartment. House keeping was pretty basic and unremarkable. The shower in the bathroom was pretty poor but the amazing surround sound system throughout the apartment was stunning and the lovely touch of the 'instant on' gas fire with real living flames were just delightful so they kind of balanced out the 'self catering' feel. The piece de resistance however was the fire pit out on the patio. Spectacular. Fiona would sit around it at night with a lovely glass of Napa red and watch the sun setting over Alcatraz. Bliss. So, having read this, I hope you understand my title of 'Mixed Feelings' Perhaps if I got over myself and wasn't such a snob I would have given it 5 stars and a perfect review. But I am and I didn't."
"We stayed for 2 nights in a 2 bedroom suite at the end of a business trip to Napa. The room was immaculate when we arrived and the bedrooms were perfect. There is a full kitchen with nice cookware, so we shopped for a few things at the market directly across the street. Nice and convenient! We found the staff to be very helpful, but there were really no issues. We would gladly stay here again. Our teenage daughter loved it, by the way."
"This is a unique hotel since it is in a residential complex. The apartments are spectacular with a view of SF Bay that is unparalleled. The apartments have a full kitchen, full sized dining room table, living room and bedroom with a huge terrace. There is also a world class sound system and multiple TV's in every apartment. The facility and apartments are clean and well maintained. There were no little rips tears or smudges in our apartment as you find in other hotels; it was perfect. Noise transference is non existent from apartment to apartment.You are registered by a concierge who gives you a tour of the complex. The concierges are there to cater to you every whim during your stay. All concierges performed well but Alex and Christine were superb, although Christine should be on the cover of Vogue. There are also butlers who serve guests and Gio is a superstar who will print menu pages for any restaurant that you inquire about and even go to the store to stock your refrigerator.Housekeeping is extraordinary; our apartment sparkled. This is a well trained and superbly performing staff.Breakfast is also provided and the offerings are extensive including hot breakfast sandwiches, eight cereals, four types of fresh fruit and assorted breads. This is a world class breakfast. There are two public areas with fire pits that are unique. In 47 years of running around the world, this has to be one of the three best hotels that I have experienced."
"The Fairmont Heritage is an absolute gem. We didn't even realize it existed until we joined part of a travel/vacation club that uses this property as their San Francisco location. Located IN Ghiradelli Square, you couldn't possibly have a better location. One block from the water, you can begin your day on one end of the waterfront and spend your time wandering the various sites, attractions and restaurants in making your way towards the Ferry Building and Bay Bridge. Once you return, enjoy a treat at Ghiradelli, which is a 10 second walk out the backdoor of the property. GREAT location. This property appears to be a timeshare property whose owners rent their properties. We stayed in a two bedroom ""residence."" It has a full kitchen, dining table for six and living room - in addition to two well furnished and equipped bedrooms. The place is clean and nicely appointed. You feel right at home. There is daily maid service just like a regular hotel and the staff could not be more friendly or helpful. There is a courtesy SUV that is available to pick up/drop off within two miles of the property. It is available on a first come, first served basis. There are two great outdoor patios overlooking Ghiradelli and with great views of Alcatraz and the bay. You are also one block from Gary Danko for those people that enjoy that quality of food (we do!).This is a perfect place for a family to stay. Our family of five has had a great time, courtesy of the location, facility and staff. Our kids made us promise to come back to San Francisco and visit at this time next year, booking the same property."
"We spent 7 days in San Francisco in a two bedroom residence, and everything was perfect. Easy check in, a helpful and kind staff. Confortable beds, excellent location. The chauffeured car was very useful, and the drivers were always very kind. For those (like me) that love cooking, they have a state of the art kitchen. Definetely we had a lovely stay. I highly recomend."
"We spend 3 nights at the Fairmont Heritage Place in late January and found it to be the perfect place to base yourself for a great time in San Francisco. We had room 313 and we couldn't fault it. The 3 bedroom, 3 bathroom layout suited us with 4 adult children, my wife and I. the services was second to none and we even had the use of a car for free to get around!!!. Its located in a great spot for all of the wharf action and only a cable car ride to the CBD.We will be back"
"We stayed at the Fairmont Heritage Place for 3 nights in a 1BR suite. We were on the ground floor and whilst it is obvious that the higher floors would have a better view we were very happy with our apartment. It was impeccably clean, spacious and well set out with a full kitchen, a fireplace/lounge & free wifi.The pull out sofa bed was queen size and so ample for our 2 teenagers 14 & 13. The breakfast was fantastic as was the complimentary chauffeur, movies and popcorn, the complimentary BMW bikes and the wine and cheese each night from 5 til 6pm.The 2 fire pits are a lovely addition to a wonderful hotel. Service was excellent. It would be hard to fault this hotel. It is close to Fisherman's wharf and Ghirardellli Square is so quaint with boutique shops and a wonderful atmosphere."
"This is my third review of Fairmont Heritage Place having stayed there in 2011 and 2012, and always in a one-bed harbour view suite. I agree with other reviewers that the location and the standard of facilities are fantastic. Do be aware though that the spectacular sweeping bay views (as per the website photos) are only a feature of some of the suites, and floors 3 and 4 are the ones to go for. We also appreciated a notification a few weeks before our stay that there would be 'seismic rectification' works during our stay which could be noisy, and offering a relaxed cancellation policy. Thankfully we decided to keep our reservation, as the noise was absolutely minimal.Some issues this time with the standard of service, which at these prices should be exemplary. Some of the Reception staff didn't follow through on requests and needed reminders - for example we stayed for 11 nights with a 3 night break midway. We were given a second floor room when we first arrived, and I asked if it would be possible to move to a higher floor for the second part of our stay. Having heard nothing for a couple of days I asked again, and the receptionist said she'd put a request 'in the system'. Again received no info on the progress of this request. When we checked in for the second time we were given the same second floor room. I mentioned my previous request, but there seemed to be no record of this although another receptionist overhearing the conversation said she remembered putting the request 'in the system'. Upshot was that they did find us a fourth floor room, and many thanks for this as the views were much more expansive. Another issue was a broken nightlight in the bathroom - needed a new lightbulb. We asked twice for a replacement - no response. It had to be referred to 'engineering' apparently. When we checked out we gave the broken bulb (still unreplaced) to a Concierge as a last resort! Overall, some of the reception staff seemed to be reluctant to extend their response beyond the basic pleasantries, and the whole operation seemed to lack coordination compared with our previous experiences. Maybe a change of management? It did take the edge off our experience this time, hence only four stars."
"We just spent 5 nights in a 2BR bay view unit at the Fairmont Heritage Place. It was the perfect location for our stay in SF. The unit came with a fully equipped kitchen, spacious living room with fireplace, large screen TV and free Wifi. The bathrooms are modern and clean. The view from the room and outdoor terrace was wonderful, and the outdoor fire pit provided a warm place to sit on cool winter nights. Ghiradelli square is directly below and has some cute boutiques, restaurants and the huge Ghiradelli store/cafe. The staff was attentive and polite, and they helped to make one of our family members' birthday special with flowers, cupcakes and champagne delivered to the room! There were two nights of noise on the terrace from fellow guests, but the staff did their best to respond quickly.We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to friends and family, and we will be back on our next visit to SF."
We have stayed at the Fairmont Heritage Place several times and have always found it a quiet respite from the hoards of Ghiradelli Square. It is on the Western edge of the square and the bay facing rooms have wonderful views. Great staff and wonderful breakfast every morning.
"I don't write many reviews, something has to be exceptional and this hotel was. The rooms are more like an apartment so for a family who want to have quality time together when relaxing this is perfect. They are also decorated and furnished to the highest standard - superior audio and visual equipment in every room and free wifi. The bathrooms are luxurious and kitchen equipment high class. The beds are so comfortable, I want one! Needless to say the room was spotlessly clean and the whole hotel had a fragrant smell to it. The view from the veranda, which has a beautiful fire pit, was of the bay and Alcatraz.Location, location, location! The Fairmont Heritage is built in the old Ghirardelli Chocolate factory and the square has lots of shops, restaurants, a diner and ice cream palour. Just around the corner is the main stop for the iconic trolley car and further along (5 min walk) are all the piers including the tourist spot Pier 39.The hotel provides a luxury car which will drop and pick you up within a 2 mile radius of the hotel and the drivers are friendly and extremely knowledgeable about their city. The same can be said about the reception staff, nothing is too much trouble, recommending and booking restaurants, shopping advice, always happy to help. We loved San Francisco, the people and places we visited, staying in this hotel played a huge part towards the amazing time we had there. Coming back to the Fairmont Heritage after a long day sightseeing was a pleasure in its self."
"This hotel provides an apartment-like suite (well furnished bedrooms, bathrooms, living room and kitchen). It is located in the old Ghirardelli chocolate factory, and some of the exposed brick still appears in the walls. The staff is very nice, and there are great amenities (free breakfast, wine and cheese at 5, a car to chauffeur you within a 2 mile radius of the hotel). The only negative is the location - well located if you are a tourist, but less so for business (far from Financial Center/Union Sq area)."
"We stayed at the hotel for a two bed room apartment for one night at the cost of 1000+ including tax and parking. The room is large and clean. But the disappointing thing is that the actual room is far different than the description of the room in the website posted on Booking.com through which we elected to book. The actual room we were given was on the street level with a dirty street right outside the windows while their posted room description has city view along with misleading ads with terrific bay view however it is far from being convenient to access and the fire on the patio was never as active as needed. It was actually shocking to us when we hit into the room, compared to our expectation based on our reading of their posted description of what to get off what they charge. We definitely will not recommend thus place for living if money is hard earned."
We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and could not fault it. Every aspect of our stay exceeded our expectations. The staff were wonderful and having the town car available to get around was the icing on the cake.
"This is a very spacious, stylish comfortable hotel. We stayed in a two bedroom apartment with lovely views of the Bay and Alcatraz. Easy walk to fisherman's wharf, the cable car turnaround and local restaurants and Ghirardelli square has a few lovely shops and restaurants. Simple continental breakfast included which was nice but often hard to find somewhere to sit.Staff very friendly and helpful and complimentary hotel car to nearby locations was a pleasant bonus.Would definitely stay here again."
"Booked a 2BR apartment for family stay for 2 nights - rates were high but the apartment was very spacious, well furnished and clean. Location was not within walking distance to major attractions but complimentary chauffeur service was provided within 2 mile - however this was on first car first served basis so the wait could be long.Front desk staff were competent and professional although I found the service a little cold. We called the desk twice to clarify the chauffeur service and the staff got slightly impatient with us on the second call (""as I have mentioned just now...""). In another instance, we had problems with Golden Gate Bridge toll payment online but the staff was reluctant to help (""we have a business centre right there so you can do it yourself. There is usually a charge if you need us to help..."") although he did help us finally. Chauffeurs and staff at the breakfast lounge were great though - attentive and personable. "
"We stayed three nights in a two bedroom bay view suite just before Thanksgiving. The rooms are well decorated and a decent size. Some bay view units are much better than others, and some have private balconies or a ""walk out"" terrace. We had neither, but the room was fine for our stay. The location is great if you have children. You are across the street from a large grass area and Aquatic park. You are also walking distance to Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39. We walked to ATT park which was 3.2 miles from the hotel, along the Embarcadero (stop at the Ferry Building for lunch). Breakfast was good, but crowded. We were unable to find any seats one morning. The afternoon wine reception is a nice touch, but the wines they pour are not commensurate with the room rates. Overall the best choice for a family stay in the city."
"I stayed at this hotel to get ready for my wedding at Presidio. We got there the night before and it was so hard to find the entrance. We entered from the Ghirardelli Square and the signs were pointing to no where. When we finally got into the hotel, the front desk person didn't offer bell service until I asked. Also she made very awkward comment, it was kind of obvious that we have a wedding dress but she asked if we are going to a show or performance. We were like um... that's my wedding dress. When we got to the room, the room was not what I expected because the pictures I saw when I booked the room has balcony which is one of the reason I booked this hotel. I asked the staff but she said it is not guaranteed and said will check for me but she forgot. We had to go downstairs to ask her but she looked surprise to see us and she just told us there's nothing available (didn't even bother to do a fake search/typing on the computer). The hotel room was very clean and has everything that we needed (except for the balcony that I expected). There's full kitchen and the room even have a ipad. There's free wifi. Bathroom is very big and clean. We didn't need to use it but the hotel doesn't come with parking. Parking is approximately $70 or $80 per day. I probably won't recommend this to friends or family mainly because of the service we got. I expected better service for the price we paid. Will not stay here again."
"Simply Perfect! Great reception, friendly staff, lovely well furnished 2 bedroom apartment, great access to all locations. Yummy Chocolate available. Great scene. Very expensive but for sure deserves every penny spent."
"I am now staying at this place. Booked a week, as the reviews were fairly good..However, I'll be checking out tomorrow.. It's AWFUL! Where do I start? Ok, welcoming was ok, but was told to wait till 4pm to check in, after a long flight from Japan airing in SF at 11.00am.. But ok. Finally got to my room. Freezing cold, flashing lights, nosey kitchen fans. So, we were moved to another same category room. Still cold, but warmed up a few hours later, a bit. Now looking for the bath to have a soak. What!! No Bath.. LOL!! You're kidding me? Nope, no kidding.. For $1,000 a night you don't even get a bathtub.. Two showers ok, but no Tub.. So, please beware of this hotel.. They don't tell you if your room has a bath or not.. Luck of the draw apparently.. The Manager, doesn't like to use any words that has apology connected to them, and has no idea how to treat clients with serious problems.. This is not the hotel you want to stay in if paying big bucks.. She offered me an extra heater an hour ago, and I'm here still waiting. I know it won't come.. It could be a beautiful hotel, but the Management needs changing. They don't have a clue! Still, all guests aren't as fussy as me perhaps, but when paying one grand a night, all I ask is for a warm, comfortable room with a bath tub.. Is that too much? At the Fairmont Heritage, it is. One other thing, check in is at 4pm and Check out at 11.00am ... So they really want you in, get their money, and push you out early.. I've made reservations already at the Ritz Carlton for the rest of the week. At least I'll have a warm room, with a bath tub, because they have just confirmed it. :)"
"We spent a few days in San Francisco on our way from London to New Zealand. We were upgraded on arrival to the spacious two bed, two bathroom suite which is magnificent. The service is excellent. On arrival we were greeted at the door; our car was parked and luggage delivered to our suite while the concierge showed us around and familiarised us with the accommodation. The suite includes washing/drying facilities, fridge/freezer, dishwasher etc; a real home from home. It was a nice surprise to find a fitness centre which isn't shown on the website. The complimentary buffet breakfast is very good and can be taken outside onto the terrace in warm weather. Very easy access to Ghiradelli square and its restaurants on foot. The hotel also has a car which can ferry guests anywhere within a 2 mile radius and pick up again afterwards. The accommodation is extremely comfortable and the facilities and service superb."
"Stayed for two nights in the two bed two bath suite and I have to say its one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in. The rooms were a very generous size and with 5 adults sharing we didn't feel we were on top of each other. With no restaurant within the hotel you had a lot of places to eat on the doorstep and a buffet breakfast which we felt had lots of choice. We had the breakfast each morning and it was always fully replenished. The staff were all helpful and check-in and out were very swift and our bags taken straight to our room. We had excellent views of Alcatraz which was amazing to wake up to on our first morning, we were very close to fishermans wharf and lots of attractions. I would highly recommend staying here."
Stayed two nights at the Fairmount. We had a one bedroom one bath with a pull out bed. The good things are the location. Very close to fisherman's wharf and pier 33 which was exactly what we were looking for. The staff was very friendly and the rooms were modern condo styled. Very comfortable. We were on the first floor so we overlooked Ghirardelli Square. Some bad things were the pull out bed was downright awful. Noisy springs kept me up at night and dug into my back. Also the router for the wifi was like a strobe light at night. Secondly there is no sound/noise barrier between our suite and the hallway. We constantly heard someone dog a few suites down and children running down the hall. Overall this was an amazing hotel and was exactly what we needed but I didn't exactly have the best sleeps there. 
"This is a wonderful hotel with a fantastic, welcoming, caring team (thank you Anna who was our amazing first contact). The extremely comfortable, well-appointed suites are a great way for families to enjoy spending time together, while still having plenty of personal space. As for the ""except,"" mentioned in the title above, the continental breakfast experience was what a guest might expect at a Motel 6. And not a good one. Arriving close to a half hour before closing (9:35), you could see that much of the food had not been replenished and some of what was there should have been replaced by more recent vintage items. A few egg croissants remained, badly ""bruised"" by previous guests and stuck to the paper tray lining. And that appeared to be the signature dish. Fresh (perhaps) fruit was overrun by fruit flies that were all over the food, the walls and you, if you went near it. Silverware was at a premium. Not a knife to be had. And not an employee to be found until I discovered the ""kitchen."" Ask for an artificial sweetener and your told the shaker marked sweetener is it (how are you to know that sweetener isn't sugar but some generic Sweet n' Low). Then at 9:58, without notice, the staff member shows up to break things down. Really? No ""last call"" notice. No waiting until a little bit after ten to give any late arrivals the benefit of the doubt? Oh, and at 10:00, I could hear the employee's iPhone alarm go off, just in case he forgot to start breaking things down before then. The net is this is a great hotel with an amazingly simple problem to fix. The fact that it hasn't been is a big miss by management. Especially, when breakfast is often a guest's last impression before checking out. So Fairmont management, get on this. You've created a great guest experience and delivered well above my expectations ... except ..."
We started our weekend in this hotel. Loved the spaciousness and friendliness of the staff. The hotel driver took us to the restaurant on the waterfront. Beautiful fire pit on the terrace. Loved the robe and slippers. My only regret was that we stayed for only one night!
"I had such a difficult time finding a hotel that could comfortably sleep my three young kids and myself, plus my mother who is in her seventies. My Virtuoso agent suggested this hotel and I quickly read the reviews. Some of them made me consider canceling which is why I was so pleasantly surprised that it was perfect!! First off, we were in 217, a two bedroom apartment. Everything is beautifully done and the room set up was perfect. My kids were swooning that it was so amazing. The breakfast was great! Why are people complaining? Plenty of different food and a great and easy set up every morning. We enjoyed the Mustard Terrace so much- my kids could play- plus the view is incredible. One night we ordered Chinese from Country sky (reco by concierge) and ate out there which was stunning- food was great too. Everyone couldn't have been more friendly at the hotel and we used the house car often which is an amazing bonus! Robbie even took us down Lombard street on our way back from a restaurant- so cool to experience and going that extra mile was so nice. Victor was awesome too- plus Kenyetta, Kristina, and Jeremy who gave my crying toddler a river otter stuffed animal at check-in. We would definitely stay here again- it was worth the price."
"We booked 3 nights in The Fairmont Heritage Place apartments to complete a 12 day holiday visiting Phoenix, the Canyon Lands (a Tauck tour), Las Vegas and San Francisco. The holiday was to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary and celebrate we did.We booked a one bedroom bay view apartment and all pre-stay communication with the 'hotel' was excellent and on arrival we found a bottle of 'Californian champagne' and chocolate dipped strawberries in the apartment. We were warmly welcomed on our arrival by private transfer (we fully recommend Execucar who made both transfers seamless.). The cheerful reception staff, contrary to some other reports, was delightful - always accommodating, helpful and attentive.Our apartment was really excellent - beautifully equipped and furnished. We could not fault it in any way - everything was to hand from high quality TV and media and Bosch washer and dryer to a lovely balcony overlooking the bay and Alcatraz Island as well as a spacious bathroom.The 'luxury continental breakfast' was indeed that - other reports that it was otherwise are surprising. Every day there were copious servings of various fresh fruit, cereals, oatmeal, yoghurts, breads, bagels, pastries and warm cheesy, bacon and egg baps. The daily 5pm to 6pm Happy Hour of wine, cheese, biscuits and fruit is excellent, too. We sat out every evening by the South African Boma style gas fires enjoying a glass with nibbles alongside views over the bay and the bustle of Ghiradelli Square - where boutique craft shops fill with tourists and street musicians play throughout the day.The apartments are spacious, luxurious and well placed to see the sights being only 400 metres from the start of the cable car system that takes you to Union Square, etc. We hired bikes from the nearby Blazing Saddles shop to 'Bike the Bridge' which we did, there and back, in under two hours - not bad for old codgers. The waterfront is just metres from the apartment and the heart of Fisherman's Wharf is less than 10 minutes walk.Will we return to the Fairmont Heritage Place - if we are in San Francisco again - a definite YES - not cheap, but you get what you pay for."
"We had a great stay here in their two bedroom apartment. Clean, lovely apartment, beautiful views of the harbour and friendly staff. Great choice if you are travelling with a family. While it is amongst the famous chocolate and ice cream places and it could be loud - it was very quiet inside. If you want to get away from it all - this is a great get away in the city. "
"By far the best hotel we have ever stayed at! Upon arrival there were cupcakes and champagne waiting in our room, since we were there for our honeymoon! The hotel staff was very attentive, welcoming and friendly. A special thank you to Christina and Victor who were incredibly helpful! The hotel room was huge and had a separate living room and bedroom with a balcony overlooking Ghirardelli Square (we could even see Alcatraz from our room). We had a washer and dryer as well as a full kitchen with a dishwasher. The service was amazing! They have a car service to take you anywhere within a two mile radius. We used this service to go out to dinner one night. The continental breakfast had great selection of treats and the coffee was delicious. Also, every day they had a complimentary wine and cheese happy hour. The location is perfect, besides being in Ghirardelli Square, it was also an easy walk to Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39. The hotel is also next to the trolley station, which we took up to Lombard Street and then walked back down. Since we did not have a car, we had a one day pass on the hop on, hop off bus. We got on the bus at Pier 39 in the morning and then got off the bus at Ghirardelli Square at the end of the day. We stayed at all 5 star hotels on our honeymoon, including two hotels in Hawaii. But we were officially spoiled at the Fairmont! The other hotels that we stayed at on honeymoon were nice, but could not be compared to the same level of quality and personalized service that we received at the Fairmont Ghirardelli. Thank you again! If we can afford it, we will be back again. It was worth every penny."
"When you pay us$1.100 a night for a room you expect things to turn out right. We made a reservation for a 2 room condo and a special request for a third bed (10 days in advance), but had to GET HERE to realize they did not have a third bed available and one of us had to sleep in the couch. I'm no prince, but I ain't couchsurfing at that price either..."
"This is a great hotel. It's expensive but worth it for the beautiful and huge apartments and the location. The breakfast is fine. The outdoor terraces with fire pits are a fantastic place to sit and look at the views. Housekeeping was great, lovely toiletries and towels. The only thing that lets this hotel down are the front desk staff. Some are polite and helpful and others are quite rude and make you feel like an annoyance just for checking in. "
"A group of three adults stayed at the Fairmont September 12 - September 20. We had room 113 which had 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. Very clean rooms. The housekeepers Joanne and Liu were excellent. The turndown staff was great as well. The space had 3 bedrooms with bath in each. The hotel room/apartment was huge. We loved each having our own space. The location at Ghirardelli Square is wonderful as is the outside decks and fire pits. The complimentary breakfast was continental style and the breakfast staff was very nice and helpful. The house car is fantastic and takes you within 2 miles of hotel and in San Francisco that is alot of territory that 2 miles covers. We loved our room on the first floor because we were close to breakfast area, outdoor deck and also close to lobby to put our name in for car service. We travel often and at this hotel we truly felt like we were treated like family. The entire staff takes an interest in their guests from everything to dinner reservations, restaurant suggestions as well as any insider information on San Francisco that they feel will help you to enjoy your stay to the fullest they are willing to share. They say Disney has the happiest staff well I have to disagree because the Fairmont Heritage Place has them beat they all work together to make you feel special throughout your stay. We would like to thank the following:Doorpersons: Tito and Teddy. Butlers: Bradley, Gio, Dustin, Dean, Matthew, Victor. Concierge: Jeremy, Cara, Cristina, Kenyetta, Natalia, Anna , Haley , and Night Manager Chris Harris. To be honest if we left anyone out it's simply because we forgot because everyone at the hotel was quick with assistance and a smile. Bradley, Gio, Dean and Victor were always so accommodating with everything from luggage, car service, or to just share a laugh. The staff made us feel like we truly mattered to them. They say there is no place like home well we can also say there is no place like Fairmont Heritage , Ghirardelli Square."
"We arrived on a friday afternoon and the staff was polite when we came in. We were expecting a gift to be waiting in our room that was shipped by UPS that day. We asked the front desk if they knew where the package was, they said no not only that, they would not even go look to see if it arrived. We asked Saturday Sunday and Monday morning, they did not go the extra step to locate our package. I was told from the shipping company it was in the hotel. The hotel denied because they were to lazy to look for it. On our departure day at the airport on Monday I finally get a email saying our package has been at the hotel the entire time and they are just sorry. It is now a week later and i finally got my package sent to my home.i thought for 1300 a night they would have been more helpful."
"It's been a while from my last stay at the Fairmont. It is still a very nice property but not quite what it was years ago. You will enjoy your stay here. Good restaurant, nice lobby and very good staff."
"We stayed in a 2 bed apartment here in July 2014. It was a perfect space for a family of 4 with 2 teenage children. Everything about our stay was as we hoped, great location, healthy breakfast, lovely terraces and a great place from which to see this amazing city."
"Great hotel. Perfect wharf location, and probably way too close to the Ghriradelli ice cream store! Excellent apartment style room with two separate bedrooms and large kitchen / family room area with all of the amenities. Good breakfast, free car service (nice touch), DVD's to watch for free at night, outside patio area with fireplaces, and the list goes on. Really a great experience overall. My only fault of the hotel was the bed / mattress was lumpy / sloping and probably needed to be replaced. Can't go wrong here though, nice stay."
"The girl at check in was nice but curt. She informed us the windows were being cleaned so ""not to touch them"". We were half an hour early for check in so we waited in the lounge which was ok but when she called us to let us know our room was ready she was working with someone else checking in, so we had to wait in the lobby until the other clerk was told to give us our room keys. We weren't shown to our rooms and never given a room tour. The bellman had to show us everything. There was a bed on the floor in the spare room which the bellman kindly took away. A beautiful room it was but the front desk really made the start of our stay frustrating and made us feel like we were an interruption. "
"This is one of the few hotels, if not the only hotel, that offers one and two bedroom condo like units in the city. This hotel is small and has been converted from a previous brick building and so the windows are not double paned which means there is noise from the street at most hours of the day and night. There are buses and traffic from three sides of the hotel.Our two bedroom condo was long, narrow and the two rooms rather small. There were also two bathrooms, washer / dryer and some nice audio and in wall speakers. The hotel though does not have a restaurant or any other facilities. The service was minimal and I had to ask for everything if not you would not get it i.e. water upon turndown, various amenities that come with the Fairmont loyalty hotel program. While the accommodations were nice, they are not spacious and the location is not very convenient (unless you only want to hang out at Fisherman's wharf). However having said that, it is one of the few places where you can get a nice view of the sea in San Francisco. The service was lacking and in my opinion not up to snuff for a Fairmont. The staff were not very helpful. For instance, upon check in they told my husband that I had to be present since I had made the reservation and they refused to check my family in until I arrived later on in the day (even though I had clearly specified at the time of booking that it would be a reservation for Mr. & Mrs and my family and had booked a two bedroom unit!)."
"This hotel is not cheap, but it's worth every penny. The location is perfect, steps from the waterfront, overlooking Ghirardelli Square and the San Francisco Bay. We stayed in a 2 bedroom condo that had a full kitchen, washer/dryer and sleeper sofa in the living room. The room had a large balcony overlooking the bay. The views of Alcatraz are amazing. You can borrow bikes from the hotel to ride to the Golden Gate Bridge. You can borrow movies and get complimentary popcorn for a night in or to entertain the kids while the adults go out to dinner. They have underground parking. Their complimentary car service will take you or pick you up anywhere in the downtown area. We made frequent use of this very helpful feature. Every afternoon there was complimentary wine/snacks. Breakfast was good, too. I have nothing bad to say about this place. Best hotel I've stayed in in quite some time."
"The Fairmont Heritage, Ghirardelli Square is an appartment style hotel located close to the heart of San Francisco in the old Ghirardelli chocolate factory building. We had a three bedroom apartment for two nights. The appartment was probably the best equipped I've come across in a hotel - full function kitchen, hi-tech entertainment centre, TVs in all rooms, washer/dryer, hi-tech lighting and heating options (a bit too hi-tech for my liking). My only complaint was the very poor lighting in one of the bedrooms. Many of the walls are bare brick in deference to its industrial origins, which gives an authentic loft-style feel.The hotel is integrated into the Ghirardelli Square shopping area with a useful but slightly disorienting array of exits, entrances, stairways and balconies. It does not have its own restaurant but food can be ordered from several nearby restaurants with hotel staff delivering it to your room. This means food can only be ordered during restaurant opening hours, which some may consider a disadvantage. A basic complimentary breakfast is served in one of the public areas.Service was personal, friendly and helpful and includes valet parkingThe appartment block feel didn't quite do it for me but this is a very good option for families looking for spacious accommodation combined with a base from which to explore the city. It is not super luxurious but it is high quality."
"check descriptuion Great location, top-notch concierge staff. The driver service was great - took us all over the city. We did have a problem with our room upon arrival but the Rooms Manager took care of it and provided great recovery for us. We experienced a fire alarm one night and the"
"It is always nice for us to find a go-to hotel in places we want to return. This would be the Fairmont Ghirardelli for us! Not only was the staff incredibly friendly and responsive, we loved the location and the breakfasts served each morning. The rooms were spacious and perfect for our family of four. We got a 1 bedroom suite which had a separate living room/dining area with a full kitchen. It was nice to have the ability to refrigerate and re-heat leftovers so we didn't have to eat out every meal which is often the case on vacation. Had we stayed longer, we could have hit a market for groceries and cooked in more. Which would have been lovely to have eaten a meal on the balcony that overlooked the square and the bay. Our son slept in the pull out sofa and our daughter slept in a comfy air mattress. A special treat for the kids was the movie delivered with popcorn. We'll be back!"
"We stayed at this Fairmont Heritage property for 10 nights recently.Pros:1)Stunning location right on the bay with gorgeous views2)Thoughtfully designed apartments with every conceivable amenity3)Furnished beautifully with no compromise4)Very efficient and friendly service from all the lovely girls at the reception/concierge specially Kristina with whom we happened to interact the most5)The bellboys and doormen were friendly, helpful and courteous at all times6)The house car service is very efficiently run 7)Lovely morning breakfast, with a sufficient variety to choose fromOverall until the penultimate day of our stay, everything went absolutely fine and we just loved everything about it. We even picked up some floor plans of the apartments as we were considering it as an investment opportunityCons:Unfortunately things went horribly wrong on the second last night of our stay there. We had a break in to the apartment at night while we were sleeping and the living room area was burgled. Our apartment was located on the ground floor, it had a patio and burglars entered through the patio door. We had not noticed that there is literally unfettered public access through a lane right up to the patio and anyone from the road can just very casually walk into the patio since the hotel has implemented absolutely no security measure, in the form of gating it off, to prevent intruder from coming in. The next morning we found the patio door open. We could not even remember anyone from our family unlocking the patio door the previous day, so we have no idea how it was open. But unfortunately that night before we slept we did not check the patio door to see whether it was locked. Amongst the items stolen was my husband's briefcase which had all our passports, visas and residency permits. We went through a complete nightmare and much trauma for the next few days somehow organising documentation to return to Singapore where we live.The response from the hotel management was extremely lackluster for the first two days and we were shocked. Here was a robbery that had occurred on their premises, through a very obvious security breach as they have unfettered public access right up to their patio through which anyone can just casually stroll in and they do not warn any of their guests about this and ask them to be careful. They do not even have their own security camera capturing movement in that area. It is not apparent from the patio that there is public access right upto it, so it is not easy for busy guests to become aware of the security threat from there. Apart from sending one of their staff with us to the police station, they did virtually nothing for the next two days. Considering our security had been breached, our identification had been stolen amongst multiple other items (laptops, ipads etc) and the very real possibility that had one of us woken up during the robbery, we may very well have been harmed (we had both our children with in the apartment) - they did not even bother to even check with us through the next two days in terms of how we were doing and whether we needed any assistance. Perhaps they were worried that we were going to sue them for the breach in security and decided to just stay away or perhaps they were just slack, but there was absolutely no excuse for their negligence. We were utterly traumatized by the experience, not so much by the loss of material items which items which one can replace, but by the loss of every single identification document we had. We had to miss our flight home. On the evening of the second day after the incident, we finally lost our patience with them and asked to speak with management. A junior manager was sent to us who had joined the hotel a few months ago. We told him how appalled we were by the conduct of management and that we were going to make a big noise about it. We demanded to know why nobody had even bothered to check on us or offer any assistance, given that we had been robbed while staying at a hotel where we were paying upwards of $1400 a night. I even asked them how the GM of the hotel had not even bothered to even call us even once after such a huge incident had happened at the hotel. After we made a big noise about it and said that we were not willing to be treated in this manner, the hotel management finally came through for that last evening we were there after we had run around madly for two days organising temporary documentation to return home. I received a call from the GM to check on how we were doing, the hotel gave us the last night free in another apartment on a higher floor (we were not comfortable with staying on the ground floor any more), they gave us a discount on the final bill and organised two cars for complimentary transfers to us the next morning. I explained to the GM that all we had wanted was some element of human touch displayed while we went through that trauma. We have stayed in the best hotels all over the world and know what service is about. I even told him that I understood that it was the first time they were dealing with a situation like this of a break in and possibly did not have a protocol in place to deal with it but surely there is no protocol required for being just humanly concerned about guests who have been traumatised while living on the hotel's premises and been robbed. They were extremely kind and solicitous once we expressed our outrage to them over the way we were being treated, but the point is that of the three days we had to spend there after the robbery sorting out the chaos, their attention to us swung in on only the last evening and that too after we had to demand it. Not expected of a Fairmont property. I do have to say that they were very helpful from the last evening onwards and did everything that I had outlined to them that they should have done. But it took a guest to outline to them, what their responsibility in the incident should be and for the first two days after the incident, we received no real assistance from them. Even after the trauma we went through, on our part we still found it in ourselves to show our appreciation for some of the junior staff who helped us by leaving just little token gifts behind for them when we left. This is what being human is about.My main reason for posting this review though is not to complain about the hotel, but to alert other travelers to not take your safety for granted even when you are in a luxury 5 star property. Keep your identification papers locked at all times in the safe (it was careless of us not to have done that, we just assumed we were safe at the Fairmont) and be careful to check that all doors into your hotel rooms are locked at all times, not just the main door. Do not leave your security in the hands of the hotel.In conclusion, the Fairmont Heritage is a stunning place to stay and convenient from every point of view. Friendly and caring front line staff take care your everyday daily needs very efficiently. Ev The apartments are just beautiful. But clearly their emergency protocol needs some attention as do the security measures they have in place. If we were the scapegoats through whom the hotel has learnt how to respond to a burglary situation and also how to beef up their security, then hopefully some purpose has been served through this and none of their guests in the future will have to go through what we did."
I stayed last four years in row every summer in this nice hotel because of out standing service but this year I noticed big difference in service from check in to check out very disappointing .. It doesn't worth the money we paid for ... Chris he checked us in was very careless and unhelpful he left us to talk with other guest general talking while we waiting in the midnight with my kids- the morning duty manager promised me that he will provide us with complementary water bottles we paid for at the end!!!! Nothing interested in this place anymore but the good location 
"Great location, top-notch concierge staff. The driver service was great - took us all over the city. We did have a problem with our room upon arrival but the Rooms Manager took care of it and provided great recovery for us. We experienced a fire alarm one night and the evacuation was efficient and professional - gave us confidence in the hotel staff around safety.We delivered food in to our room from a neighboring pub on 2 nights - great quality, easy delivery. Concierge lounge area had a nice breakfast. Afternoon wine and cheese was a little sub-par for the level of hotel, but satisfactory. (Little variety)We used the hotels bikes one afternoon to bike to the Golden Gate bridge - wonderful!Overall - simply outstanding for our family."
"The Fairmont Heritage Place in Ghirardelli Square (San Francisco) is an amazing hotel. It is actually more like a condominium (2 bedrooms and full kitchen). The wonderful staff will pick up food from any of the 3 restaurants around the hotel for you. I was a bit concerned because some hotels that have kitchenettes are not very luxurious, but the Fairmont was amazing! We have two small children and staying in this hotel with kids was absolutely wonderful. It is definitely 5 stars (and I am a very picky). The location is also amazing. I have stayed at many luxury hotels and this was by far one of the best. We will never stay anywhere else when traveling to San Francisco."
"This hotel is fabulous. Perfect location with amazing rooms. We only stayed one night, but I wish I could live there! Seven of us shared a suite, with two bedrooms, two baths, and ahuge kitchen/living room with a pullout sofa.The kids were in awe. I lovedthe exposed brick and thehuge windows in the bedrooms. The best part of the hotel is LOCATION. You can't get a better spot to enjoy the city! We walked down to the waterfront, went out for dinner, and then back to the hotel. When we'd all decided that we had room for ice cream, we just walked out the back door of the hotel and straight into Ghiradelli Square's shop for some to-die-for desserts! The hotel also has patios with fire pits that overlook the square. Amazing. The next morning-- breakfast included. What more can you ask for?The only problem we hadthe entire time was trying to get parked to check-in. The lot we were directed to was full, so we pulled up to the front of the hotel and had to Valet park, which was about $60. That's the price you pay for being smack in the middle of the action!"
"Wow. Just wow. I found this hotel on Trip Advisor, so I really have to pay it forward and review it too, so maybe another family will find this hotel and enjoy it as much as we did! Stayed here with my family of 5 for 4 nights. if I could have stayed a week, I would. This property was just amazing in every single way. Location, amenities, cleanliness, service, décor, employees. I can't think of one thing I would change. Everything from the Le Labo soaps to the ultra-attentive concierge and front desk staff was just above and beyond expectations. This is the perfect location for exploring San Francisco, but a warm cozy place to come ""home"" to after a day of sightseeing. I loved the town car service. With a family of 5, this was a nice amenity and we were able to use the car to go to and from a few nice dinners in the city (Slanted Door and Trattoria Pinocchio- I recommend both!). My husband and I enjoyed coming home at night and pouring a glass of wine and sitting by one of the fire pits. My kids enjoyed to movies that came with a complimentary bag of popcorn. The units were beautifully furnished- wonderful bedding, beautiful showers and a functional kitchen area. Breakfast was delicious and just enough to start the day- loads of fresh fruit, yogurt, oatmeal, and a hot entrée each day. You are close enough to the action of Fisherman's Wharf without having to be right in the middle of it. The smell of Ghirardelli chocolate greets you when you walk out the door. I'd recommend this property to anyone. I can't recall a nicer hotel experience. If I could give this rating 6 stars, I would."
"We started our California trip selecting the perfect sight in San Francisco. Everything about the Fairmont Heritage is top notch. The Front Desk was delightful and very informative on the location, property, things to do and the rooms. A great welcome. The room was one of the best we have been in during our travels. Spacious, clean and everything we needed and expected, including great night's sleep. The staff was top notch as well. Anything we needed was there immediately with a warm smile. Housekeeping staff was accommodating beyond expectation, anticipating the extra towels we needed the following day. Anything and everything you could expect and not expect were in the room. Breakfast was incredible, from the preparation to the service. It was like living in a palace. We knew exactly what to see and where to go thanks to the informative staff that were mo4re then eager to make sure our San Francisco stay was a memorable one. We did not want to check out and gave a serious thought of spending the rest of the week here. We will definitely return to this incredible place."
"I have never before written a review on trip advisor but I rely a lot on others' reviews - and well... this hotel deserves one. I was not expecting anything spectacular - just a good location and for a decent rate. We have stayed in many many Four Seasons, Ty-Warner, Fairmonts, Ritz, etc and almost every time with our kids (they all really cater to our kids and our crazy requests even at 3am for glasses of milk or diapers!). We normally book suites or at least two connecting rooms, probably should mention we have four chidren all 7 and under. I was surprised when booking this hotel that we only needed one and were paying FAR less than other hotels for suites (or in this case apartments). We had 1800 sf in the heart of everything San Francisco has to offer a tourist! We walked everywhere! And where we didn't, we had the house car take us. We had a two bedroom and the room sizes were huge! They each had a massive bathroom in addition to a full size kitchen, dining table, and living room - and everything was in great almost brand new shape. We don't cook while we are on vacation but it was nice to have a fridge (which they stocked with two bottles of Napa white wines and a 6 pack of Anchor Steam before our arrival). One day we asked for a few nannies and a car to take us up to Napa - within hours we had two college students at our room with games ready to hang out with our kids while we were taken in a private s550 an hour up to some of the most amazing wineries! You asked, they delivered, every single time. This hotel had the feeling of a small boutique hotel. You had one person with which all of your requests were handled (babysitters, car service, reservations, room service, etc) so it made it a lot easier. We ended up extending out our stay for two more nights because it was so great! And a side note: We budget quite a bit for vacations as our family is quite large, but this hotel doesn't mark up ANYHTHING. You have a list of menus from restaurants in the area and they add $25 for delivery and $5 for tip (there is not even a check to sign to tip more so you don't feel obligated) - for us, having a full breakfast with our family size (and even a cousin!), having an $80 meal was unheard of! They are always north of $300 each time. They do also have a really great free breakfast in the morning (it was just easier to keep all of the kids in the room to eat). After my husband checked us out he had this puzzled look on his face and normally it's a look of fear because he just paid the bill, however he was convinced we should have paid twice as much for that trip! Upon leaving we went down to So Cal and stayed at the Montage in Laguna Beach, and while this was now our 5th stay and we really love the Montage, it just didn't compare to the Fairmont Heritage Place as crazy as that sounds. We even contemplated buying an ownership interest but we are just not up there enough - but as soon as the opportunity presents itself you can bet we will!"
"This hotel is great! We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment and it was fantastic, they are huge!, decorated amazingly the standard of the rooms and furnishings is incredible, like living in a millionaires mansion.The staff are very friendly from, sitting down and checking in while eating the ghiradelli chocolates, to the 'butlers', drivers and turn down service staff. We requested a few things over the stay and staff were straight to the room with ice, coffee or whatever we required.Breakfast was fantastic different foods everyday plus the same basics and essentials, cheese and wine seemed poor, I popped down about half way through to grab a couple of wines to take back to the room however the options were very limited.Back to the rooms, and they are fully equipped with, ipad, dishwasher, washing machine and dryer etc etc etc. the best part being Bose speakers built into the ceiling throughout with individual controls for each room.Would definetly return!"
"We would go back to the Fairmont Ghiradelli Square in a flash if we were able to. Our apartment was incredibly spacious and clean, and comfortable. The staff were some of the most helpful that we came across on our US trip, and we particularly appreciated the complimentary car shuttle around the Bay area. The nearby restaurants were great and breakfast at the hotel was plentiful in quantity and number of choices. We had a city view room but as we were out most of the day this was not an issue. Next time, we'll try a bay view room."
"Fairmont Heritage Place is a residence club which mean on site amenities are limited but in exchange you get spacious accommodations to have quiet time away from the kids or vice versa. But amenities are not necessary when you can walk/run/bike the 3 miles to Golden Gate Bridge or sit on the expansive private deck to watch the fireworks away from the crowds. These are front row seats for fireworks because the residence is steps from Aquatic Park. You can swim in the Aquatic Park along side the hardy SF natives. The sandy beach is a great spot for the kids to play and the adults to people watch. Across from the residence in the plaza is McCormick and Kuletto's, they have incredible seafood and more great views. The bar is cozy and serves quick bites better than most hotel restaurants. Close by are many other great dining choices. If you want to cook in the gourmet kitchen, Alito's, is the go to place for fresh Dungeness crab and is only a few blocks way. Go early, they only keep morning hours. You really do not need to cook or keep food on hand with the residence providing breakfast and afternoon wine and cheese. The only real draw back is the many stairs like the rest of SF. If you have mobility issues be sure to ask where all the elevators are located. Transportation options abound from the free house car service to the trolley to the free/rental bike choices."
"Fairmont Ghiradelli Square Huge Rooms and Amazing Views! Stayed February 2011.Extremely delightful staff, complimentary Cadillac Escalade hotel transportation around hotel, amazing views of the Bay and Alcatraz, huge 2-bedroom, 2 1/2 bath, fully equipped kitchen, living, apartment-sized stacked washer & dryer, complimentary can of coffee, all in the heart of Ghiradelli Square. We stayed during President's Day weekend and had the cable cars, shops and piers within walking distance. We did utilize the complimentary Escalade to a recommended nearby brunch cafe. The location is ideal to the stated areas, the hotel staff rated 5 stars for customer service and our room was much larger than I expected. Complimentary continental breakfast is included for all guests. It's enough to get your energy before the daily tourist activities."
"What a place! Beautiful apartment, fantastic views, great location, helpful staff. We were upgraded from a city view suite to a bay view (thank you). The spacious suite was perfect for our family group, the beds were comfortable, the showers efficient. One small point was that, although there were plenty of bath towels, flannels and small hand towels, there were no towels of an appropriate size to use as a turban on my wet hair.My daughter used the laundry facilities but the tumble drier kept stopping a couple of minutes into its cycle resulting in us having to carry wet clothes with us. This did not stop our enjoyment of this superb apart hotel. Breakfast was fresh and plentiful. all-in-all a great find."
"Second time we stayed here and although there were some changes to offerings from our stay in 2009 when hotel was brand new, it is still a wonderful home away from home when visiting San Francisco. The suites are really like condos with modern fully equipped kitchens. Ours was a two bedroom. Both with king beds. The one surprise was the second bedroom didn't have a bureau, so the person using that room had to live out of her suitcase for three nights. The hotel offers a complimentary breakfast each morning and in the afternoon, wine and cheese. There is a courtesy car which we took advantage of. Staff is top notch and friendly. Location is great ... easy walk to Fisherman's Wharf or in the opposite direction to Fort Mason Park."
"We recently stayed at this hotel for the 3rd, maybe 4th time. A two night stay at the beginning of the trip and a 3 night stay at the end. We started with a 3 bedroom suite (by the elevator, so not the quietest). We love the comfort and location of the hotel. We ended our trip with a 2 bedroom on the 3rd floor REAR corner room (in case you're wondering what the 3R on the elevator means). I would normally give this hotel 5 stars but, due to a potentially alarming incident which brought the rating down in our minds is when our 12 year old son's friend (who was traveling with us) became separated from us on a biking trip through Golden Gate Park. We were disappointed the hotel refused to pick him up when he called for help. Bottom line: independent kid, rented bikes, he got separated from us, he returned bike to shop, called hotel who let him know he was out of the 2 mile radius, so he walked what he thought was 2 miles in whatever direction some stranger pointed him toward, asked a (very young) woman to call hotel, hotel STILL said he was out of the radius, so she was kind enough to call a cab, pay for cab, gave her # to him to confirm he got there safely. I'm not incredibly happy the hotel did not recognize a child was in need of help. We gave him our cell phone numbers, which he promptly lost, apparently, but he remembered the hotel name and location. Shame on the hotel for this incident, which I will never tell his mother about, at least until he is off and married. I would stay at the hotel again, though. The housekeepers, Frances the driver (when you can get him), and Teddy at the front door are all terrific."
Suites were huge and extremely comfortable. Location is superb - it was lovely sitting out in the patio overlooking Ghiradelli Square. Breakfast served at the executive lounge was nice - plenty of fresh fruit and a variety of cheeses.Pet-friendly too!
"I wanted to do something out of the day to day routine and pamper my fiancée with a good night out, I placed my booking for a king sized bed and had them place a bottle of whine in the room. spacious outdoor area, and it had a good music system, overall a great stay."
"""1400 sq feet of space in the city"" - said a friend in praise of this place. I figured 1400 sq feet of a fairmont space couldn't be bad and so I went ahead with this. The last time we were in San Francisco we stayed at the four seasons. Somehow I just did not enjoy that property. Was too ""cold"" and market street was too busy and too shopping oriented for me. So I wanted us to stay at a different location. This one right next to fishermans wharf at ghirardelli square sounded interesting.I didn't realise at the time that it was a fairmont residence and not a hotel. The fairmont hotel is at union square. So when we checked in I was a little concerned about that. This meant no pool which was a disappointment for the kids. Also no room service but one could order food from the nearby restaurants the menus of which were in the room. They served a reasonable - but could have easily been better - breakfast. And the common areas were limited. The outdoor terrace with a fire pit and lovely views was nice.But over 4-5 days the place grew on us. The apartment was very comfortable and spacious and nicely done. Huge living area. Small but comfortable bed rooms. Nice kitchen and dining. Washers and driers. We had a two bedroom apartment. The housekeeping was excellent with daily cleaning and a turndown service that was provided late into the evenings as well. Spotify on the hotel ipad connected nicely to the music system and we enjoyed nice music throughout our stay. The house car service was convenient and we made full use of it. Concierge service was excellent. The kids loved nearby pier 39 with its arcades and street performers. My wife missed staying closer to the shopping areas. She had to trek over there every day. But because of all that driving back and forth I think we got to see more of the beautiful city and it's varied vistas. On the whole it was a lovely stay and a nice change from staying in the market street / union square area. I would highly recommend it with the caveats I have already mentioned above. "
"We visited over Father's Day weekend and loved our three day stay. From check-in to leaving, the staff was accommodating and very friendly. The location is great--walking, by cable car or taxi--but the car service was very useful especially to local restaurants. We had a two bedroom with a full kitchen and a pull out sofa bed that was very comfortable. Wish we had been on a higher floor since we overlooked Ghiradelli Square rather than the bay. The breakfast was good, not great, but the afternoon wine/cheese service was very nice. Highly recommended; while pricey, it was worth it and we look forward to a return visit."
"The place is lovely to look at and it is well positioned, both in a tourist zone and yet insulated from it. Management blunders spoiled our stay however. Single beds could not be provided, breakfast buffet was merely acceptable, coffee was weak, key cards were inexplicably switched off, the heat could not be turned off, there was no mini bar, no room service, no bottled water, windows wouldn't open and wake up calls were sent to the wrong rooms. The staff, in response, was less than helpful. A pity. Needs work. "
"Very expensive accommodations. We booked a two bedroom because we wanted to be on the water. We were room 406 and had awesome views of the bay and Alcatraz Island. Very close to dinning and shopping. However, our rooms were very noisy! A lot of local traffic all day and night on Polk Street, so if you book a room make sure it is away from that corner. We booked two nights and was grateful to leave and would not have stayed another night in that room! Also there is no restaurant on site though they do provide a wonderful breakfast in the common room and provide trays to take it to your room. Also at 4 there is wine and cheese. "
This place is excellent but should be chosen only in the right circumstances. It is not a hotel!! It's truly a wonderfully restored building of private residences for rent. Service is good but there is not even a bar! To get a drink you have to go across the street and buy a bottle at one of the two neighborhood liquor stores!Each apartment is fully equipped and ready for a family or having a dinner party( if you want to go to the grocery store ). If you need a spacious accommodation with more than bedroom this may be the place for you. But get your wallet out....because it's pretty expensive. Location and views are spectacular and make it worth it (almost).. 
"THis hotel is beyond top notch. It is the most perfect location for exploring San Francisco. They have a car that will drive you up to 2 miles anywhere for free. free breakfast. Amazing service to every detail. 1, 2 and 3 bedroom suites. our family of 6 (4 kids 6 and under) were treated incredibly."
"In good location, decent, luxury hotels. It is nice place for corporates and perople are coming to visiting this place first time, everything you found all around. Most of the monuments are as Golden Bridge, Alkatraz Ireland, markets, Bay bridge, markets are just close by. Over all is good place to stay.Wishes!!!Raju India"
"The two-bedroom unit was the ideal place to stay for our family of 6: 1 senior, 3 kids ages 10 and under and 2 adults, especially while fighting jetlag. Here's why: 1. fully equipped kitchenette with free Peet's coffee (other food stuff you can buy at a convenience store across) and dining table for 6. This was most helpful especially when kids were hungry at 2am and our senior wanted to sleep; 2. living room with complete entertainment set-up; 3. washer and dryer room with free detergent and fabric conditioner; 4. powder room; 5. separate toilet and bath in each bedroom; 6. soft bed, high quality linen, fluffy towels and bathrobes, in-room slippers. For perfection, wider breakfast menu (more warm food choices and hot chocolate NOT request basis. This is Ghirardelli Square, after all) and housekeeping cleanliness standard can be improved. Additional tips: 1. in this inn, there is single king-sized bed and ""split"" king-sized bed (? which was more like two single beds to us). Specify what you need. 2. 3rd party airport transfer is better than in-house. We went twice to SFO within the month and used 3 airport transfer services: bare-bones GO Lorie's, Fairmont's in-house/endorsed and 5 Emerald Limousine. The last one was the best choice based on value and service. "
"This hotel/residential hybrid is not a typical luxury hotel, so potential customers should understand what it is and isn't. Our experience was mixed, finding some excellent features but troubled by a seemingly weak management hand and lack of some typical 5 Star hotel offerings. The hotel is part of a probably failed condominium development and the combo hotel/residential properties never seem to hit the right balance, being neither fish nor fowl.The location is smack in tourist central, Ghirardelli Square, so that can be a pro or con, depending on your needs. We selected a two bedroom unit. It had two decent sleeping rooms and a comfortable sitting area. There was a long table for dining, a wine cooler, washer/dryer and microwave. The refrigerator was a small pull out drawer, certainly not ample enough for truly stocking up if that was your plan. As well, the area is not full of grocery options, but I imagine they can be found if apartment life is what is desired. I can also imagine that a family might like the feel of these units, providing a bit of elbow room.On the other hand, on vacation, my druthers is for true hotel amenities, especially at this price point ($1,000 per night). There are zero extra amenities, not even a bottle of water. I asked for decaffeinated coffee for the room which didn't come. No mints on pillows, no mini bars and room service is limited and comes from off site restaurants. As well, help wasn't always at hand - on several occasions, nobody answered the phone in the lobby. There is a continental breakfast which was complimentary and decent. The whole experience felt a bit inconvenient, though someone just wanting space and was willing to chase down all food and beverage needs might not mind.I know that there is reputed to be a car to take guests to local destinations. It was never offered to me on the few occasions I asked for options on how to get to certain nearby places, but that might not be the typical experience. The staff was genial, at least the ones we encountered.We had a unique, unpleasant experience that was disappointing and would stop us for staying at this hotel in the future. While this set of circumstances might not repeat themselves, the total lack of management follow up suggests that any glitch in a guest's stay might not be resolvedin a satisfactory manner. Here goes:Our suite, which had a bay view, had a very odd location that required entry from outside. It would not be ideal in a storm, for sure. The view was lovely, but the suite was located on the beautiful deck which was a public area. There was a large window in our living area that faced the deck and any passersby could look directly into the room. When we checked in, I expressed my fear that this would provide a true lack of privacy. I certainly didn't want to close my curtains and miss the view, but I also was uncomfortable about people looking right into the room. And I mean right into the room, not from a distance. The very nice check in clerk did not know if other rooms were available and assured me that there was very little foot traffic on that deck, so we took a chance.The following morning, we left for a few hours but planned to return to the hotel for an afternoon of rest and reading on the deck. Well, that didn't happen. At 2 PM food and beverages were being set up right outside our window for a large cocktail party. The guests came around 3 PM and stayed officially until 6, but unofficially much later. People were literally staring into our room and the 120 or so people made so much noise talking and laughing that we couldn't even hear the TV in our room. Essentially, our room was rendered useless for many hours and it was particularly frustrating because I had expressly raised a concern about noise/privacy and was not warned of this event.I called the front desk during the event and expressed my unhappiness and absolutely nothing happened. No note of apology, no basket of fruit, no call from management or any of the typical things a good hotel would do reflexively. When we checked out I once again voiced my unhappiness over the situation and the gentleman who checked me out told me he was aware that management had been discussing our situation and he wouldn't close our account untilthey had figured something out. Guess what was done? Nothing at all. So my advice is, if being at a competently run hotel that will stand behind its product and provide ALL services expected at an expensive property, this might not be for you. If you are happy to have fewer services but want a decent apartment feeling unit in a touristic area, this might be worth a go. I suspect that there are many differently layouts here as it is not a cookie cutter building, so I'd be certain to ask questions before booking and decline a room that doesn't feel quite right. While our set of circumstances will probably not develop for you, the prospect of being blown off by management if something else isn't satisfactory definitely exists."
"What an amazing place to stay! Our family of 2 Adults & 2 kids (9 & 12) stayed here for 4 nights, we had a 2 bedroom apartment which was fantastic, the place was huge, a lovely open kitchen, dining & lounge room (with sofa bed), came with surround sound stereo system which my hubby was in heaven with, a gas fireplace, washing machine & dryer which after 2 weeks traveling was fantastic to have. Both bedrooms were spacious with separate showers in each & a bath as well in the master bedroom suite. The staff here were extremely helpful with everything we asked, gave info on the city for us, they had a town car which we made use of by a driver taking us wherever we wanted to go, drove us to Market Street shops one of the days so the kids could get custom-made Converse shoes from 1 of only 4 Converse places worldwide that do custom made shoes/clothes. This was great as we certainly would've got lost if we had to make our own way there or pay a taxi to take us. Then all we had to do was ring & they would come & collect us. What a fantastic service. Breakfast daily was great, I really can't say enough about this fantastic hotel, would highly recommend it to anyone going to stay in San Francisco. Nice & close to a large selection of restaurants as well. Also had hotel bikes for use if you wanted."
"This place blew my mind away! Outstanding rooms, service and view. Amazing. 5-stars. It's quality is unrivaled and pristine. The other reviews are accurate and I feel totally pampered. There is so much that I can describe and not ruin the fun of experiencing this first hand. This time to wind down and relish this luxury now, on the patio with some cheese and champagne while the sunsets."
"This place is incredible! We went to San Francisco for a lowkey bachelorette party and we wanted to stay at a hotel where we would feel pampered. Definitely chose the right place!! Every staff member was completely courteous and accommodating. Never once did we encounter anyone that didn't have a smile on their face. The residences are fantastic! Clean spacious rooms, full kitchen, living room, washer/dryer. Everything you need!They have a complimentary car service available which we certainly utilized throughout our stay.You also get a complimentary continental breakfast daily. There are some reviews on here complaining about the breakfast not being up to par. The breakfast was great! There was coffee, teas, juices, cereal, breakfast burritos or sandwiches, pastries, oatmeal and fruits. Not much else needed. The location is perfect and the views amazing. I can't recommend this place enough! We had such an amazing weekend and can't wait to come back! Thank you to the manager, Clay, for the tour and taking care of us. Also thank you to staff members Gio, Dean, Dustin, Matthew and Diogo for driving us around, bringing us more blankets, being totally adorable and putting up with us 7 girls!! "
"We stayed at the Fairmont Ghirardelli for 6 nights as our base for our first visit to San Francisco in April 2014 and we were not disappointed. We chose an apartment rather than a hotel as it gave us more flexability. The hotel is in a good location near Fishermans wharf , but far enough away not to get any noise disturbanceWe were lucky to be upgraded to a bay view apartment which was a very good size with fantastic views of the bay and alcatraz. The apartment was well equiped and pre ordered groceries were their on our arrival.The staff were very friendly and the overall service was excellent.Small negatives were , Breakfast selection could have been more varied and the cheese and wine hour we found to be disapointing. This hotel is not cheap, but if you can afford their prices I would definitely recommend a stay"
"Stayed in a 2 Bedroom with full kitchen. The room is outstanding and the beds extremely comfortable. The location is a bit touristy, but if visiting San Francisco for a vacation, it is fine. convenient to the Cable Cars and Fisherman's Wharf. Views of the Golden Gate and Alcatraz. The think I can't get out of my mind was the outstanding continental breakfast. The best fruits and pastries I ever had. Will be back."
"We stayed at two hotels for a total of 5 nights during our visit to San Francisco in March 2014. We stayed at the Fairmont Heritage Place, Ghirardelli Square for 2 nights we wished if we stayed there more. Great location with walking distance to Fisherman's Wharf. They have deluxe apartments and exceptional service. Some apartments have great view of the bay. We really enjoyed it and we highly recommend it specially if you are travelling with kids."
"Loved this place. Huge 1 bedroom apartment! Full Kitchen, fireplace, flat screen tv, sound system, great patio overlooking Ghirardelli Square. Great location, steps to Fisherman's Wharf . Wish we could have stayed longer. Absolutely the best!"
"Our family of two adults and three kids stayed at the Fairmont at Ghiradelli Square for four nights over spring break. From the start this was an exceptional experience with a warm welcome and a concierge-guided tour of the property. Our two bedroom suite was well appointed with a complete kitchen, comfortable bedrooms and a beautiful view of the bay. Having a washer/dryer in our suite was a big asset. The property is very charming with restaurants and shops just steps away. The cable car stop is close by and made it very easy to get up to Union Square for shopping. The house car service was an added bonus and helped us get to restaurants and museums. I was initially worried that we would be too close to the craziness of Fisherman's Wharf but it is a couple of blocks away from the hustle and bustle and felt quite peaceful.We all enjoyed the continental buffet breakfast. The fact that there was no restaurant at the hotel was not a problem for us as we were happy to enjoy all the wonderful dining options in the city for lunch and dinner.All the staff were incredibly helpful. When the concierge discovered that we were doing the Alcatraz tour the next day she sent up the Escape from Alcatraz DVD for us to watch the evening before, along with a bag of popcorn.We look forward to staying at this wonderful hotel again in the future."
"We stayed for 5 days, 4 nights what an experience, this hotel was the jewel in our trip to the USA . We highly recommend this hotel. Luxury and location. The one bedroom apartment facing the sea was just what we needed for three adults. The buffet breakfast was the best. I loved the service and attention from the young staff in the breakfast room. They were a credit to the hotel management and the welcome feeling of this luxury hotel.We will come back to the Fairmont on our next trip to the USA."
"Our family of six stayed in a three bedroom unit at the Fairmont Heritagefor Spring Break in March, 2014, and found the size, location and amenitiesperfect for a family trip. We really enjoyed the car service, which was great for trips to Union Squareor nearby restaurants. The breakfast buffet was also a nice addition whenthere are kids traveling. We would definitely stay at this property again, and recommend it for familieswanting an upscale, very nice, roomy hotel!"
"We stayed with our family of four, 2 teenagers and us. The location, overlooking the Bay and Alcatraz, was beautiful to wake up to. The staff was all very friendly and accommodating. We took advantage of the concierge to help plan several activities. We rented a car for one day from Enterprise, and the concierge had it delivered to the hotel. That day we went out to Muir Woods and Hawk Hill. We were blessed with the most beautiful weather and clear skies. The car service was great. It is first come, first serve, so it wasn't always convenient, but it was a great perk, none-the-less. The drivers were also bellman, and were very friendly and informative. We would definitely stay here again. We would recommend it to anyone traveling to San Francisco, unless you want to shop everyday in Union Square. It isn't on Fisherman's Wharf, but it is close. They serve a light breakfast everyday which is satisfying. The ""residence"" is very comfortable and the perfect place to come back to after a long day of touring the area. For frame of reference, we were also looking at the Ritz and the Four Seasons."
my family and I just returned from vacationing in California. our last stop was SF. we could not have picked a better option for a hotel. everything from the service to the staff was above excelent. Worth every penny. the interaction with ghirardelli sq. is simply amazing. the service is 24 hrs of anything you need. it feels like home. Jonathan M
"My husband and I planned a destination wedding and wanted it in San Francisco. My Mom and sister were attending as well as his parents, sister and nephew, among others. We wanted a hotel that would comfortably accommodate us and this was just perfect! First of all, the location at Fishermen's Wharf is fantastic, but the hotel is the star. It is the site of the original Ghirardelli Chocolate Factory so it is loaded with historical artifacts and interiors. We reserved two 2-bedroom condos for the 8 of us, 4 in each condo. Each condo had two separate bedrooms with baths, a large fully stocked kitchen, dining room, living room with fireplace, iPad, washer/dryer, etc. etc. It is only a few steps to the shops and restaurants of Ghirardelli Square and 5-10 minutes walk from everything in the Fishermen's Wharf area. Continental breakfast and wine tastings are every morning and afternoon. However, as much as we loved everything about the hotel, we thought the staff was the friendliest and most accommodating of any hotel we have stayed in. They always greeted everyone and went out of their way to make our stay comfortable and fun. Staff members we had not met even congratulated us on our marriage which was amazing! You cannot go wrong at this hotel!"
"We stayed at this apartment hotel inFebruary , 6 in our party .We took advantage of the 4 for 3 nights offer as although the adults were only able to stay for 3 nights the youngsters stayed on the extra night . We did not use the kitchen to its full advantage , but had we done so it was well equipped and very clean . There was even a first aid kit under the sink and cling film , foil etc , a thoughtful idea as this was the third location on route home from Hawaii and the most equipped kitchen in 3 rentals.The staff were knowledgeable, obliging and endlessly patient with 2 youths in our party who quizzed them constantly about nightclubs!All the front of house staff were great and the use of the hotel car was an added bonus as we didn't rent a car at this stage of our trip.Wish we could have stayed longer to explore the area more and taken advantage of the fire pits in warmer weather .! Would recommend this hotel however for comfort , cleanliness , location etc .One criticism ; the breakfasts were uninspiring , as vegetarians we could not eat any of the hot food and food was slow to be replenished even at the start of breakfast service . The bagels I was told by my family were stale each morning .Breakfast and cheese/ wine tasting ( we tried this once)n could be improved . But otherwise a great stay."
"This is an exceptional hotel in a wonderful city. We visited San Francisco and stayed here for a week to celebrate my mother's 80th birthday. The common rooms of the hotel are elegant and sophisticated, dark woods and fresh flowers make an excellent first impression that is carried though the rest of the stay.The two-bedroom apartment we booked was wonderful, clean and spacious and superbly equipped. It's nice to stay in an apartment in a good kitchen including Wolf and Sub-Zero appliances, even if we only used it to prepare the occasional light meal. The beds were large and comfortable and the bedrooms both had black-out blinds. The nightly turndown service always left Ghiradelli chocolates on the beds (two people in a four person apartment? Extra chocolates every night!) and the morning paper was always waiting for us when we got up. The sitting ear has a large screen TV, excellent sound system and even a real fire - wonderful for sitting by.The real highlight of our stay was the care and attentiveness of the staff. Nothing was too much trouble for them and they were always polite and cheerful. The hotel has several BMW bicycles available for guests to use and there are suitable bike paths all 'round the San Francisco area. The Golden Gate Bridge is within riding range if you fancy the exercise.One of the best perks, however, is the house car. This is a complimentary, chauffeur-driven car available to guests on a first-come, first served basis. The car will take you most places in the city and pick you up again - just phone reception to ask if it's available. This made places like Union Square easily accessible.The hotel overlooks Ghiradelli Square and the balconies have wonderful views out over the bay, including the Golden Gate and Alcatraz island. During they day they make wonderful sun traps and at night there are large braziers and provided some welcome warmth."
"Wow - what a fab hotel. Situated in Ghiradelli Square with a few cool restaurants and an ice cream parlour/chocolate shop! View of the GG Bridge and Alacatraz from our room and a short stroll away from Fishermans Wharf and all of its shops and restaurants.Our room was fantastic, felt like a luxury hotel room but was fitted with a fully equipped kitchen which was great for a night when we just wanted to chill and watch TV. The staff are amazing - so helpful. They recommended a fab restaurant for us on our last night and drove us there ( and picked us up )in the complimentary shuttle car! They have complimentary wine and cheese in the bar every afternoon and a complimentary breakfast. We loved it - we would most definately recommend and stay again. Thank you for helping to make our honeymoon so special"
"This is a few months late ....but I wanted to ""pay back"" all of the great reviews on TA that led me to this gem! My family of 5 spent a long weekend here (my kids first visit to SF) - we stayed in a 2 bedroom apt - which is much more comfortable than 2 adjoining hotel rooms! And what a beautiful apartment it was - complete with top of the line kitchen appliances! And a fabulous view of the Bay and Alcatraz!!! (worth the extra money!!)Although I was hesitant about the location (having always stayed around Union Square when traveling without kids) - it ended up being one of the many great things about the place! Not many hills to walk up; close to the cable cars for when we wanted to go ""up hill"" - and the car could pick us up later!!; we took advantage of the bicycles and had a wonderful - easy bike ride across the Golden Gate Bridge; and within walking distance to the ""kid friendly"" things to do on Fisherman's Wharf; and even close to ""In and Out Burger"" which is always high on my children's to do list when we travel out west :) Did I mention the Ghirardelli chocolates that were always available? (the kids won't let me forget that!)The breakfast buffet was fabulous! The staff was lovely! The common areas were beautiful!! ...I could go on forever! Fantastic place -- I just love the Fairmont properties!!!"
"The Fairmont Heritage Place, Ghirardelli Square is one of the best place i was with my family first the way you are welcome at your arrival provide you with a good test concerning the rest of the stay,We took a 2 bed rooms aprt as we were a party of 5, better than at home the furniture and all the details in the room as a wine chiller,the fire place, Ipad to surf on the net and all the rest are great and very much appreciated,The best was when we request a movie they also provide us with popcorn bag for the children.so niceThe location is the best in town you can walk to the pier, and the famous chocolate factory shops is near by under the hotel.A place to recommend to stay if you want to have a super personal services and especilay if you are coming with family"
"We've stayed at a couple of nice spots in SF including some of the nicer hotels in the Financial Dist but this place at Ghirardelli Square definitely tops the bunch. The rooms are apartment style with kitchens and center islands adjacent to a sweet dining room table. Couch and TV, fireplace. The balcony overlooked the square and water.Best suited for a group of friends or a family I'd think but either way, take advantage of the space. If I could live here that would be ideal. There's also a common space with an outdoor fireplace and some dope couches. Nice people and free chocolate, nuff said."
"Wonderful staff, location and spacious accommodations. Nice breakfast items served daily, easy happy hour with wine and cheese from 4-5 pm. 2 bedroom suits are fully furnished with varied views and layouts but all are spacious and the kitchens are fine although only one small fridge drawer. A fgreat location to enjoy the SanFran waterfront."
"Amazing room with views over the square and alcatraz. Perfectly positioned to walk wherever you wish to go within a short stroll to Fishermans wharf. Its well equipped with everything you could need and an amazing dining table. Would definitely stay again. Special mention to one of the doorman, who drove us in hotel town car and was very kind and sweet."
"My favorite place to stay in SF!It is not really a hotel. More like an apartment. Roomy, well equipped, clean. AV equipments are getting outdated, however. Location is somewhat isolated, hard to get taxi's. There are some deli's outside."
"We stayed here in December and found these apartments are situated in a beautiful bayside area of San Francisco. The rooms were amazing and it was definitely our favourite place in our entire trip overseas. We would highly recommend this place to stay as it is quiet, not far from Fisherman's Wharf and you get all the fancy little extras like the house car, washer and dryer, bikes to ride around the area, as well as breakfast included in the total price. The lady who cleaned our room (I forget her name) but she was very friendly and did an excellent job making sure every need was met. This is a top class place to stay and if you can afford it - definitely stay here!"
"We stayed here as part of our honeymoon road trip for a couple of days. We were upgraded to a two bed apartment (street facing). The apartment was huge and it was great to have some space (especially when you are away from home for a couple of weeks). It’s the small things that really make this place, like cupcakes when we arrived to congratulate us on our marriage, there is a tin of coffee by the machine so you can make coffee in the morning, washing tablets by the washing machine. Someone has actually thought about how your stay will be relaxed – rather than trying to making you buy all these items for an overinflated price. We felt really relaxed here. As other reviewers have mentioned the hotel is really serviced apartments, so you don’t have that luxury hotel vibe.There aren’t restaurants in the hotel however there are restaurants in the square close by – in fact the restaurants were closer to our room than the restaurants which were in our hotel in Vegas. We ate at the nearby McCormick & Kuleto which was ok but I wouldn’t recommend. We also ate at Sotto Mare (the town car took us there) which was fantastic. We really enjoyed the music in the square whilst sitting on the terrace with wine and cheese. The terrace is shielded from the wind so makes a great place to relax. Breakfast was fine, very simple but nothing to get excited about. Cereal, toast and coffee were all available. We used the town car lots and found it was generally available."
"Was there over Christmas holidays. Excellent location, great views and very convenient. This place has first class service, even a includes a great breakfeast and complimentary ride on a Cadillac SUV to places within a two mile radius. Classy touches like a ""Christmas surprize"", morning paper and an amazing fitness room. Everybody is very friendly and helpful.Walking distance to most attractions in SF.Advise not to eat at McCormicks and Kaluto's, expensive and not the greatest food. Go to Scoma, especially if you like seafood. Fresh seafood right off the dock."
"We did a California road trip in July and August, starting in San Francisco and Fairmont Heritage Place. We really recommend this hotel for families. Great service and beautiful rooms overlooking the San Francisco Bay. The rooms are large with their own kitchen, which is great if you have a jet lag from travelling from Europe and the kids (as ours did) wake up and get hungry at strange times. The rooms also have washing machine facilities and a DVD film library.The only thing we missed was a pool for the kids, since the weather wasn’t good enough for swimming in the ocean. If you are planning on going to San Francisco a good advice is to book a trip to Alcatraz well in advance, as the tickets are often sold out."
"This Fairmont apartment bldg is well-located, with a beautiful view of the San Francisco Bay, and furnished with modern furniture and appliances. We stayed in a two-bedroom unit, the second BR being a loft room, with 21/2 bathrooms. It came complete with an oven- microwave, washer-dryer, and a drawer type ref. What I noticed, though, was that some small necessities were not provided, such as hand towel hangers or robe hooks, such that we had to place the hand towels on top of the lavatory counter after use. And for the bath towel, we just had to use the glass shower door handle. We were provided with plush robes, but we had to hang them in the closet cabinet after use, or leave them on top of the counter, as there was no robe hook. It was nice that there was a washer dryer complete with soap_ but for clothes that we didn't want to dry out completely in the dryer, there was no retractable clothes string where we could hang them, neither was there a rod in the bathroom to put hangers on. There was also no anti-slip mat for the shower stall, such that it was rather slippery. However, I am giving this review 4 stars because the unit was clean & well maintained and had a fairly large dining table with enough dinnerware, glasses, cutlery, cookware. It was also nice that there was an outdoor area on the second floor of the building with a fireplace,overlooking the bay. There was supposed to have been complimentary breakfast, but on the morning after our first night there, the place ran out of breakfast food_ as that was the morning of New Year-- maybe just too many guests, and fewer staff working. Fairlmont Girardelli also provides free shuttle service to places wthin two miles from their location and this was good. They could shuttle you to a nearby Safeway store, for example. Overall, our experience there was good, some oversight on their part (which could be corrected) notwithstanding."
"We stayed here for four nights in December with a 7 months baby. About a month prior I received an email from the hotel concierge Jeremy who offered to make all kinds of travel arrangements for our stay at the hotel. We took advantage of this and had some spa and restaurants booked in advance.The two bedroom suite was spacious and spotless. The baby crib and high chair were both ready for our use and we even got a set of baby wash products to use. Breakfast was small but better than we expected! (We thought it was continental breakfast, but there's warm omelette wraps, delicious! ) the wine and cheese afternoon receptions is more limited in choice but still a nice bonus for the stay.The only downside is the complimentary car service - they told me to call for a return car about 15 min before finishing dinner, but when I did call, it was almost an hour wait for the car. I understand it's first come first serve, but it seemed difficult to get a car. Other than this, we enjoyed our stay very much! "
"This is an excellent establishment - quality fitout with the usual Fairmont service. Apartment style accommodation in addition to light complimentry breakfast, wine and cheese from 3 to 5 and complimentary hotel car for journeys up to two miles. For our family of seven this was a cheaper and far more practical option than three hotel rooms with the book 3 nights and get fourth night free option. Good location near most ferries, Hyde St. Cable Car and on mjor bus routes. If you have a couple of hours to spare visit the ship museum at the bottom of Hyde St. Children under 15 are free and adults are $5- the large ferry boat and the fully rigged clipper are outstanding."
"These serviced apartments are in a great location, and are very well furnished and maintained. The breakfast was described to us (Europeans) as continental but we thought it was much more substantial than that and very healthy (although they did offer some delicious pastries too). There's a farmers market on Sundays at Fort Mason which has high quality fruit, vegetables, cheeses, nuts, flowers etc (I didn't see any meat). The quality is much better than the nearest supermarket. We stayed on the fourth floor with a view toward Alcatraz, and it was very quiet at night; much quieter than most of San Francisco. There is a generous supply of good quality toiletries which are replaced daily. And lots of towels. My suggestion for improvement is that the shower needs to be stronger and in 414 they need to add a cabinet into the bathroom where the gap is. The food served at the evening drinks is a bit meager. I would definitely return."
"Our family stayed here during December 2013. We searched for an apartment that would be big enough for our family of 5, as we were not too keen to move into separate hotel rooms.We liked:* The great location of the Fairmont: we were right in the wharf area with all its tourist attractions.* The magnificent views over the bay: we woke up every morning with Alcatraz and the rest of the bay framed like postcards through our windows.* The staff at the Fairmont: the whole team was very professional, efficient and helpful; nothing seemed to be too much trouble at all.* The apartment itself was very comfortable and convenient. We specifically liked the washer and dryer in the apartment, free wi-fi, televisions, stereo systems, etc. etc.* The breakfasts were simple but sufficient.* The small gym was probably better equipped than anything else that we have seen at other establishments over the years.* The outdoor fireplace and patio was sublime; we enjoyed sipping wine in the evenings while snuggling up against the fire and enjoying the views.* The complimentary vehicle service to destinations within a 2 mile radius of the Fairmont is just soooo convenient.We disliked: absolutely nothing!"
"This was our second stay at this wonderful establishment, and we will definitely be back. A great place for family and friends especially during the holiday season as it wasn't as crowded. Everything was wonderful, clean, spacious (we had the 3 bedroom), and quiet. The staff was exceptional, they were friendly and helpful. Can't wait to come back next December..... Cheers!"
"This hotel apartment is sumptuous and fabulous. It had everything we needed, particularly the daily need of laundry facilities for our cycling wear. It is situated in a really pretty area and is close to plenty of good eateries. "
"Recently stayed in this apartment hotel. The whole experience of staying here was excellent.From cleanliness to friendliness, it was mostly faultless. I stayed in a very spacious two bedroom apartment. The bedrooms were roomy and the lounge, kitchenette area was also very spacious. my only small complaint about the accommodation was the fact that the baths and the secondary bathroom were on the small side. I have to say that this problem was more than compensated for by the fabulous views we were so lucky to have overlooking the bay area and Alcatraz. It was soooo tempting to attempt a swim over to 'The Rock'!!The staff were very attentive and the hotel provided a huge SUV for free transport to anywhere within two miles. The hotel was also well located for the very touristy Fishermans Wharf, which was fun, and well located for catching the famous cable car for a ride downtown. Breakfasts were very good swell. Another tiny glitch was the lack of a bar, though there is a very good pub within five minutes walk which also provided excellent food. The apart hotel is also quite expensive but this was compensated for by the fabulous views and a bed that was the most comfortable I have slept on in years."
"The residences at Ghirardelli Square have fantastic views of San Francisco Bay both from the units and from common areas. Particularly nice is the Mustard Terrace where you will find an expansive deck and outdoor fireplace. Our unit was a large one bedroom which was well furnished. The kitchen was fully functional. Situated west of Fisherman's Warf, the hotel is away from the hustle and bustle of downtown. This is not the place to stay if you are in a hurry as it will take you awhile to get to Union Square or the Bart."
"My daughter and I had the pleasure of staying at the Fairmont Heritage on our recent vacation. The hotel is a standout and the service is exemplary. The beds are like sleeping on clouds that are lined with the finest linen and the rooms are extremely generous in size. the bathrooms are gorgeous and the bath was huge. We had a 2 bedroom suite and everything we could have possibly wanted was there. Excellent location, excellent service and I can't wait to return. Complimentary driver and car within a 2 mile radius."
"We just completed our fourth stay at the Fairmont Heritage Place Ghirardelli Square. The service was great, and some things have improved but the hotel is showing its age. The furnishings are tired and worn, and it's time for some updating. The showers did not get hot, and in fact barely warm enough. On our departure day my wife said she would wait until we reached my parents house to shower, rather than using the hotel shower (due to the temperature).The breakfast was great and the staff were very accommodating. We still love the location and room style and size, so we will be back….maybe.For $1000 per night (2 bedroom bay view) the details do matter, so hopefully the hotel will pay attention to reviews like this and make some changes.The hotel was ranked number 1 in SF for quite a long time, but I can see why it has slipped in the rankings on TA."
"Stayed here in Nov 2013 and thought the concierge and front desk very accommodating. The were very quick to book tickets for Alcatraz, and they took us to and from restaurants in the complimentary car, often at very short notice.The room was very nice (114), with a nice view out onto the Ghirardelli Square, and a side view of the ocean. Bed was super comfy.The location was convenient for the piers and Alcatraz, plus it was close to the turnaround point for the trolley bus. (This is a fabulous trip to Union square for only $6). My main problem was the lack of amenities - no gym, no pool, no spa, no bar to gather at night, no restaurants.In addition, the water pressure in the shower was embarrassingly weak - come on, get this fixed as I expect a good pressure in a hotel of this caliber (and price). Nice shower cubicle though!"
it is a while ago since i stayed there. but i remeber the roams clean and the beds very comfortable! the hotel is well situated near the pear. the breakfast was very good :D the staff was friendly and the fitness good
"My wife and I stayed here for about one week. When we arrived we were checked in immediately and given white glove treatment. We got a ride to the pier to catch a boat to alcatraz by the Fairmont Cadillac SUV. The room was great. Two big bedrooms with two bathrooms a lovely modern kitchen with a big dining room table and very nice living room. Three big screen TV and a ststereo system that was big enough to accommodate a nightclub. The concierge was top notch, always there to help us and suggest attractions. The location was amazing.If you are able to stay here, you must. The breakfast was very good but they need more tables to seat their gust without waiting. Don't get me wrong, if we had to wait for a table it was only five minutes or less but I do not like to wait. "
"When we checked in we were told they were working on our room and it would be ready in about an hour and they would call us as soon as it was ready. No call, checked back and the room would be ready for another hour. We are finally given our keys and walked to the elevator with directions on getting to our room. 35 minutes later I call down to see where the bags are the only apology I get is from the bellman when they are finally delivered. One bedroom suite was very nice, loved the fireplace and the view. Wine and cheese event was a joke. One small plate with 9 pieces of cheese, a small amount of a spread, two dried apricots and a small clump of grapes. This was for the entire event. Breakfast was a great surprise and very nice. All of the waiters, bellman and valets were great. The concierge and manager were sub par. Great location but not up to a Fairmont and most assuredly not worth the price."
"My husband and I stayed here for 10 nights, 4-14 November 2013. We had a one bedroom apartment.Let me first say, in spite of the 3 stars, that I really did enjoy staying here. Everything already said is true, so I won't repeat all that, except to say that the bed is probably the most comfortable I've ever slept in. So I'm going to preface my review by saying, I'd rather have a really comfy bed and wake up refreshed, that a sparkling room with an uncomfy bed.I've given the Fairmont 3 stars due to the price they charge - we paid $599/night, and for that price, you just don't expect worn furnishings (as mentioned in the review below “Staff is Phenomenal, but suite had problems!”). Our bed base was peeling, and the cocktail table was scuffed and peeling. I felt this was unforgivable, given the price of the rooms.On the whole, the staff was great, but housekeeping was iffy. In spite of leaving tips every day (which I thought was generous, given there were just two of us, and we were out most of the day, thus very little mess), we got home one day at 4.30pm to find our room had not been serviced, and we had to arrange for that to happen. On another night, we received no turn-down service. On a third day, it seems as if the duvet had just been hurriedly pulled up over the bed, and not much else done.Minor annoyances for a room of this price: - there only two hooks in the bathroom; the bathroom was quite large so there was plenty of space for rails or extra hooks. - the water pressure in the shower (we did not have a bath in our room) was quite weak, and would wax and wane during the shower.- the windows were modified so as only to open about 10cm. This was really annoying - we paid the extra for the fab view and my husband, an avid photographer, was frustrated about not being able to open the window to take pics. What's with that? Please, Fairmont, treat us like adults, we're not about to fall out the window!!I have left the worst for last. The breakfast. On a good day, it was okay. But, on the third day, my husband fetched a couple of pastries to eat in our room to better enjoy our view. Except... well, please look at the photo I took. Is that mould on the pastry? They were both like that. I chucked them away, and I did not eat breakfast in the hotel again - especially since, the next night at the free cheese and wine, I picked up a couple of grapes and they were filthy. Like, dull until you wipe your finger over it and leave a clean, shiny streak behind. Surely they should have rinsed them first? So, feeling very dubious about the kitchen hygiene, I did not eat anything there again. This is not acceptable for an establishment of this calibre.Without the stale pastry, I would have rated the hotel 4 stars. I did absolutely enjoy staying there, but I think that if they are not going to do the upkeep, they need to drop their prices accordingly. It is disappointing to expect luxury and walk in to see peeling furniture."
"The apartment style suites are beautiful. Full kitchens including wine refridgerator. Full dining table, Fantastic music system. Gas Fireplaces. Very large balcony over looking the bay and the stores. The balcony even has a heat lamp for those cool evenings. There is a common second floor balcony with a fire pit for entertaining. Large bedroom off the living room with it's own door out to the balcony. Washer and Dryer are in the suite if needed.Get to know the conceige. Anna was ours and she was wonderful. We asked for a reservation at an Italian restaurant that the locals go to. She hooked us up and we were delivered and picked up by the hotels complementry car service. The food and wine were great and we got back to the hotel early. The next morning we took the hotels complementry BMW bicycles for a ride over the Golden Gate bridge and back and then toured the waterfront. Thanks Anna, I hope you enjoyed the cheese cake!Many top notch hotels are beautiful and well appointed. The proper training of the staff is expected at this price point. This location really made The Fairmont Heritage Place special.We walked to the waterfront and sat in a piano bar, enjoyed the many shops (very touristy but who cares), enjoyed Alcatraz and the many dashing sailboats from our balcony and cherished the bike ride over the Golden Gate Bridge in the morning fog. The Golden Gate Bridge is a 15 minute ride by bike and there are dedicated bike paths the whole way there."
"We spent 4 nights in a two-bedroom, two-bath suite. The hotel's location is perfect, the breakfasts fantastic, and the staff (concierge, doormen, butlers) were amazing! We especially appreciated Christina and Clay, and their friendly, efficient attention. The hotel car was a great amenity, and we used it a lot! We did feel, however, that our unit (115) was not in top-notch condition. The cocktail table in the living room (with leather/vinyl around the edges) was peeling, and the carpet in the second bedroom was filthy. In addition, the master bath smelled like mold/mildew. The water in the second bedroom shower never got hot, and we had to ask twice before it actually was fixed.We enjoyed our stay, but we felt that for the suite should have been in better shape for the price paid."
"I called the hotel after I made my reservation online and asked if we could check in early and they said they would make the request for me. When we arrived, at 12:30, we were told our room wasn't ready. We had a 3 bedroom apartment and it took longer to get ready. They said about 2 hours. So my family and I , 5 of us total, went to grab some lunch. We came back at 3:15 figuring our room was ready and were told that it was still getting worked on. We sat around waiting for another hour and didn't actually get our room keys until 4:15, which was 15 minutes passed their ""guaranteed check in time"". We get into our room and it's nice but the end room, room 113 right next to the front door. Nobody at the front desk warned us how loud it is being so close to the front door. Also the hardwood floors in the kitchen and hallway of the actual room are nice to look at but carry ALL the sound throughout the room making it very noisy. TV is directv and there is no option to purchase any movies in the room. They do have a movie rental list you can check out at front desk but they are all old titles which are not appealing. When we checked in they bragged about their car service that would bring you to anywhere within a 2 mike radius AND pick you up once you were ready. We had dinner reservations at a nearby restaurant that was 1 mile away so we wanted to use the car. The staff was adamant that all members of the party had to be at the front door and it was a first come service. We got the ride and were told by the driver to call about 15 minutes before we were done to get a ride back. So I called 20 minutes before our dinner was ready and was told driver would be there in 20 minutes. So my family of 5 waited on the corner for the driver on acold night. After 40 minutes I called hotel to ask where driver was and was told that he should have been there and should be there any minute. We waited another 20 minutes and no driver showed up. We were freezing and had to get a taxi back to the hotel which was hard since there were 5 of us. When we got back to hotel we told them to cancel the car that was supposed to pick us up and they seemed to not even know that we called, even though as I was talking to the concierge I saw the address and my cell phone number on the pad of paper on her desk. For over $1,000 a night the location is good --- but service, amenities, and staff are not up to par. PICK ANOTHER HOTEL INSTEAD OF STAYING HERE. "
"We traveled at the end of the Summer and enjoyed our nice size accomodation as well as the top notch service. The food was well presented with many options for my meeetings and then the family later on. I love most Fairmonts I have stayed at and always choose Fairmonts first. At times I step away but thankfully I stayed in SAnFran here. It was impressive. The staff are attentive and well mannered. Maria was a big hit and wish we could have her again in the future. I will make sure I ask for her by name. She deserved recognition. A highlight was being so close to the wharf and enjoying street side crab and cold beer in the can, right on the street. A nice treat for the entire crowd."
"Very good place indeed, but the other comments were so laudative that I feel necessary to outline some less than perfect points, so that other readers are not disappointed : - If the location is great and the place is clean, the furniture is already a bit used, and sometimes unsufficient (eg no bin in bathroooms, no rincing shower in bathtubs, ...) - What is not said about additional beds is that they are not comfortable , and that they are located in the same room than the kitchen, with the noise of fridges and other appliances. Not great really.- The ""house car"" is a dispointment (a ""joke"" said my kids) : only operates in a 2 mile radius, means (i) to places which are at walking distance, and (ii) too short to reach about all of SF's places of interest !- And finally a somewhat surprising checkout, where I had to ask the bill to be redone twice, since some undue parking charges had been added. Rather unpleasant I have to say. Otherwise the teams are very customer dedicated, and some nice ideas (such as the popcorn brought together with the DVDs you order). But the overall rating certainly is not 5, and it fell somewhat short from our expectations."
"We just stayed in this hotel and were blown away by how beautiful it is and what great service we had. Everyone from the Valet, Bellhop, and Concierge (check in) were wonderful and highly accommodating. We stayed in a beautiful two bedroom with a private patio. The place is clean, perfectly located and an absolute MUST to stay at. I highly recommend this place and know that we will no longer stay anywhere else but here. Jeremy at check in/out was GREAT as was everyone we had contact with. This place is a real gem."
"We stayed here for only 1 night but it was brilliant - so wish we could gave stayed longer.The room we were in was more like an apartment. We had a room which had a fully equip kitchen, dining table, sofa etc. there was a cupboard with washing machine. A lovely sized bedroom and a large bathroom and toilet. We had a large outside area overlooking Giardheli square. Could just see Alcatraz over the shops opposite.The hotel is in a great location, an easy walk to fishermans wharf & fort mason."
"We stayed for three nights with our son and daughter-in-law in an apartment on 2nd level, with the lovely fireside just close by out the front door. Situation is just great so close to all the tourist sites on Fishermans Wharf. Staff were professional and helpful, andthe courtesy car a big bonus. The apartment was well presented and just right for the four of us. Breakfast was excellent, and the view of the bay so close was delightful. Highly recommend this boutique apartment hotel to anyone seeking a well situated, clean and friendly holiday base."
"We spent a family vacation here. We got a two bedroom apartment overlooking the bay with a view of Alcatraz. Our room was really nice, the location was beautiful; we were close to the touristy stuff, like we wanted, and the staff took great care of us! We were glad we stayed here, would be happy to come back!Our family wanted to do a get away vacation weekend to San Francisco. My wife and I had last visited the city five years ago, and our kids have never visited. For this trip, we wanted to go all-out on the tourism stuff and decided we wanted a place in the Fisherman's Wharf area, but with the kids!! Oh btw, our kids our 24 and 22. About our room. We picked out this place because it's really a boutique, apartment style, hotel, not a posh uber-hotel like the very nice ones on Nob Hill. Our room was two bedrooms, but one of the bedrooms was an upstairs loft, including full bath. The downstairs had a full sized kitchen (with icemaker that turned out to help alot later on), dining room and a nice living room area, featuring a big window view of water front. The downstairs bedroom was a master suite, including a bathroom. There was another half bath at the entry. A total of 3 flat-screen TVs.The room came with an iPad and good WIFI service. By the end of our trip, we figured out that the rooms were probably owned by an independent party, and the Fairmont was managing them. These were really nice rooms!Some nice touches: the staff stocked our refrigerator. The hotel has really nice bicycles. We checked them out, to bike over the Golden Gate Bridge. The hotel has a couple of cars (really SUVs), where the staff will drive guests anywhere in a 2 mile radius. These were busy, but that was ok, the hotel was one block from the cable car terminus and was on a street with lots of taxis. The hotel had a small breakfast area that served a nice light breakfast buffet. Some hot food, but mostly continental breakfast type food... no formal dinning here. There's afternoon wine and cheese. On the location of the hotel. The hotel is in the original Ghirardelli chocolate factory building. Our room was in the Mustard Building, dated from 1911. The original shell of the building is still there, but the interior has been gutted and rebuilt into beautiful condos. If you are walking on Fisherman's Wharf, and look-up and see the building with the big Ghirardelli sign, our room was on the third floor roughly underneath the G. Each evening we went out onto the the Mustard building's 2nd floor terrace area and sat by the fireplace. One Saturday night we enjoyed a fireworks show... really nice! No doubt, the reader can tell by my description that this place is very expensive. Cable Cars. There are two main North-South cable car lines. The hotel is really close to the Powell/Hyde line. If you are coming here as a tourist, you need to plan time to ride the cable cars. Most of the time is spent waiting in line. We did the cable cars first thing. We arrived on Thursday and we knew the lines would get even longer as the week end approached. For our ride, we hopped off at Chinatown; we walked through the tourist area, bought some tea, and then took a taxi ride back. We were tempted to hop off at Lombard Street (the famous twisty-turny street), but we were afraid that if we did we wouldn't be able to get back on -- the cable cars were jam packed, including people (eg like our son!!) hanging off the sides.Bike the Bridge. For bicycle enthusiastic, biking the Golden Gate Bridge is a great way to experience the city. Our hotel lent us their private bikes and pointed us in the right direction. You start in the Fisherman's Wharf area and follow the well marked bike paths West along the water front. You'll go over a couple of steep hill, then stop at the key photo spot (you'll know it when you see it, it's the famous view on all the post cards), take your pictures of the bridge, and then get on the bridge. This is a little scary. The bike path is shared with pedestrians; it's roughly three bike-lanes wide, with the bay on your right and auto traffic going 50mph on your left. To make things even more challenging, there are super hard bodied bicycle pros sharing the space with total amateur bikers, so with all of this as a background, this was alot of fun!!At the end of the bridge, you ride a short distance up a hill then downhill the rest of the way to Sausalito. We stopped there for a sidewalk cafe lunch, then we caught the ferry back to Fisherman's Wharf (actually Pier 41). The ferry is all setup to take bike riders and you can buy tickets on the boat if you are rushed.We thanked our hotel for the bikes! We had some challenges crossing and were so happy to get back. Hop-on, Hop-off tour bus. If you are still reading this far, you need to know about a very touristy option, especially suited for people who injure themselves biking the bridge. While not serious, the bike ride really hobbled me. I needed to rest but the day was beautiful and I didn't want to spoil our weekend, so we decided to take one of those tour buses, you know, one of those Hop-on, Hop-off buses that you told yourself that you'd never take -- well we took one. Our concierge helped us pick one, and we got on at Fisherman's Wharf. It took us around the city, including a joy ride over the Golden Gate Bridge. We though that we'd get on and off several times, but we so enjoyed our tour guide's informative and funny presentation style, that we decided to stay on for the full 2 hour loop. I have been to San Francisco maybe 10 times over the years, and I was delighted and surprised to see so much new and different."
"The Fairmont Heritage was more that we expected. The location is perfect and staff tremendous. The rooms were well appointed and beds very comfortable. The views were amazing and every day had a surprise. The kitchen was an added bonus so we could bring food back to the room and enjoy the views. The best part of the hotel is the people who work there. We had so many great tips and it really enhanced our visit. The hotel car made all the difference. The breakfast was a great start to the day and we enjoyed using the hotel bikes for our morning rides. The surprise of the week was that we got to have bread, cheese and wine and watch Oracle win the Americans cup. The terrace was a great place to relax and unwind. First class all the way."
"Years ago when they were converting this to a hotel, I always wondered how it would turn out. The answer is; great. WIth a lovely decor, great outdoor patios to sip a glass of wine, awesome views, easy access to long walking trails and nice breakfasts. We loved the sunset by the fireplace while looking out at the ocean. The car service is perfect for drop offs to restaurants and easy to get a taxi back. ....and of course the comfort of knowing chocolate could be found in countless combos just a few steps away. You are close to everything in the core with a calm and gentle atmosphere to come home to."
I've had the occasion to stay at this fabulous hotel located right injured Valley Square in San Francisco the hotel is very very old but holds a lot of historic history the rooms are spacious and confortable and the service is Impeccable the restaurant on the top floor is all luxury and the upstairs bar is a great place to meet clients after dinner not far from napa valley and wineries your treated like a king upon check in
"Our favourite hotel in a 3 week Californian tour! That said, its more like serviced appartments with a concierge service than a true hotel experience. We booked an exquisite two bedroom appartment with views directly over the Bay and out to Alcatraz. The appartment was expensively furnished and extensively equipped, with kitchen and washing facilities - ideal for a family stay in San Francisco. The staff were super-helpful, booking us tickets for Alcatraz and the Giants, and generally looking after us really well. Location is also great, directly above Ghiradelli Square. There's no hotel restaurant - though breakfast is served in the lounge - but with so many restaurants and cafes right in the neighbourhood, it hardly matters. This appartment-hotel is a great set-up. Reccommended for the discerning traveller."
"Fantastic hotel. Amazing views over San Francisco Bay and Alcatraz. Staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough to help. Apartment had everything we needed, beautifully furnished and comfortable. Ghirardelli Square area is lovely and very convenient for Cable Cars, Trams and walking about.Would definitely staff here again."
"The Fairmont Heritage Place is located near the ""touristy"" area of San Francisco, which was great for us since we were tourists! The front door staff was very friendly and helpful. The concierges were inconsistent. Clay Kubata was wonderful helping me make restaurant reservations, but another young woman concierge said she would help us plan our trip to Sonoma, but she never followed through. The rooms are large and have very nice kitchen facilities. This is good for families, but my husband and I were there by ourselves and felt the hotel was too family-oriented for what we wanted. There was the sound of small children running through the hallways early in the morning. Another negative about this hotel is that it does not have a restaurant. They do serve a continental breakfast in the lounge area each morning, but it was very basic and not that nice. I would only recommend staying at this hotel if you plan on using the kitchen facilities in the rooms. Also, don't stay here if you like rooms on upper floors. It's only two or three stories high."
"Probably best place for hotel in San Francisco. It lies right accros the bay from Alcatraz, you can see Golden Gate from certain rooms and piers are in walkable distance. We were accomodated in suite which was room big enough for 4 adults (and probably even a bit more). Couple things bothered me; as it is Fairmont I would not expect to hear from housekeeping that they have to clean your room now because in 10 minutes their shift is over. Also, breakfasts are made only from fruit, coffee and biscuits (this was probably the main weakness of the hotel). Even though it is part of Ghirardelli Square, hotel itself does not have own restaurant."
"We stayed in room 314 for five nights, and the entire experience was sublime.From the moment we entered the hotel until we left, we were thrilled with every aspect.Our room overlooked the bay, with views of Alcatraz and the Golden Gate bridge.The room itself was magnificent, with an incredibly comfortable bed.The facilities in the room were also excellent, with kitchen, washing machine, dryer, iron, toiletries, and enormous TV in lounge and smaller one in bedroom. The provision of a house car for guests on a first come first served basis was added bonus.And every staff member we dealt with were pleasant, professional and helpful.Lovely touch by hotel were cupcakes to celebrate my husband's 60th.Only complaint (being picky) could have done with better water pressure in shower.Would highly, highly recommend this hotel."
"Absolutely the BEST place to stay in SF!! 5 star+++++We have stayed at all the top hotels in the last 10 years since we are there 3 to 4 x per year. Hotel Drisco, also Excellent; Four Seasons, excellent; Ritz Carlton, real nice; Mandarin Oriental, nice; Omni, average; Argonaut, ok but not in top 15. But none compare to Heritage PlaceHeritage Place we have now been to 4 times and it is hands above all the others in many aspects. Even more so if you have family on the trip. The two bedroom apts are the best. The second floor baloney overlooking SF bay is a great place to sit and read or just watch the bay.Serive is outstanding and they meet your every need."
"One word - amazing. Everything about this place - the location steps away from Fisherman's Wharf, the concierge who secured otherwise unavailable Alcatraz tickets and gave loads of good restaurant tips, the two-bedroom apartment with two bathrooms, a fireplace and every imaginable amenity - everything exceeded expectations. The only confusion was about the names - this is not the famous palatial Fairmont hotel in Nob Hill, something we only realised upon arrival."
"This is our third time staying here in the last four years. To say this is the best hotel is such an understatement. Wish there were 10 stars to give and I would still wish for higher. We got a two room city view. You can't beat the unbelievable luxury you get - plus all the amenities - full kitchen, refrigerator, oven, washer/dryer, etc. Two king sized beds (they seemed bigger than queens), two separate rooms with a living room in the middle and a pull out sofa. Three tvs, two full baths. It just made my stay in San Francisco that much more pleasant. The kids loved the outside fire pit and pool table. We took them walking to the beach and around Ghiradelli Square. The employees were so kind.The valet parking is $50/day I think, with in/out privileges, but there was plenty of parking around the place so we didn't use."
"I travelled with my wife and two teenage kids to San Francisco in Aug 2013. We had originally booked the Fairmont on Nob Hill but switched to the Ghirardelli Sq at the last minute as the idea of an apartment appealed more than shared hotel rooms. We weren't disappointed. We had a huge 3 bedroom suite (room 213) with a kitchen and sitting room which made a perfect base for our 3 nights while we explored the city.The concierge (Hayley and Josh) were very helpful with restaurant recommendations and booking tickets for the Giants vs Sox ball game. The use of the hotel car was an added bonus when we needed a life to restaurants.Breakfast is buffet style and with fresh bagels, fruit, burritos and cereals enjoyed on one of the balconies. Drinks on the other balcony with a gas fire to keep the cold away is a great way to enjoy the views of the Bay and Alcatraz.The apartment is expensive but combined with the location, is strongly recommended."
"This Hotel was built in the old Ghirardelli Chocolate Factory. I have stayed in a two bedroom apartment with a gormet kitchen, living room with fireplace ( important for San Francisco´s wheather ) and also a dining area. One bathrrom for each bedroom and also a toillete near the living room wich also has a sofa bed.One of the services most used for us was the Hotel Shuttle. It is avaiable for small trips like Union Square, Any ten minutes trip arround the Hotel, and it is a complimentary service.The Hotel is connected to Ghirardelli´s Square where you can find a lot of shops, fantastics restaurants and just steps way to the Cable Car.They offer complementary breakfast and wine and cheese from 5 p.m to 6 p.m.For sure, one of the best hotels i have stayed."
The location is great and the building is magnificent.There are a lot of lovely shops and restaurants around the hotel.Good points: the complimentary BMW bicycles and the outdoor terrace.The room was really big and well decorated. Only two minor complaints:- our room was dark;- some of the furniture were damaged.But the major complaint is that we found the hotel lacks atmosphere. Only a small reception area with no real bar (even if there are plenty of good options around). The breakfast room isn't lovely and the food was disappointing.Maybe our expectations were too high or we simply didn't appreciate the aparthotel concept...Next time we will stay somewhere else but go for it if you are a big family.Stay october 2011
"Stumbled across this place while searching a suite for 2 families to stay in. Not easy to do in the middle of S.F. We were going to give up and stay at the Embassey Suites near the airport, until this gem turned up. The place consists of approx 50 suites that are mostly owned by fractional owners (1/10 of a year ownership). They do have some units that they make available for hotel rooms. These are all suites (1-3 bedrooms) with full kitchens. We were fortunate enough to get placed in the Clock Tower Suite (2 bedroom and 3 bath). We had a wonderful time. Just know that you will definitely pay the price for the level of service and amenities this place offers. Here is my detailed review.Locations: As other people have mentioned, this is a perfect location for those wanting to experience S.F. Initially we thought it was close to the Square, when we pulled up, we realized that it WAS the Square. We pulled up to the curb and valeted our 2 vans (front door is easy to miss. Not a big sign but right at the corner. The stairs right outside our room led us directly into the Square. We were a short walk to eateries including the famous Ghiradelli cafe. We were a 5 min walk from the cable car starting point. And about a 15 min walk to Pier 39. We felt that we were in the center of the action.Checkin: We were greeted right away and I went straight up and was checked in within 2-3 mins. The room was ready earlier than our 4pm checkin. The front desk lady immediately led us straight to the room. Room: This room was fantastic. Apparently its a favorite of Clint Eastwood and is on sale currently. Its over 1600 sqft and has an upstairs den with the most amazing view of fisherman's wharf and the bay. The upstairs patio led to the rooftop. We could look down at the square and just people watch. The bathrooms were all perfectly appointed with nice bathroom amenities. There was music playing from the nice entertainment system. The kitchen had all of the pots, pans, cups, utensils, and appliances that you could dream of. Everything you need for an extended stay. There was also a platter full of Ghirardelli chocolate. I just wished the room had a bay view from the kitchen. Service: I thought that for the most part, it was phenomenal. There were times when things were either forgotten (crib that was requested took 6 hrs to get there, in room dining menu took about 3-4 request to finally arrive, etc.) or delayed. However, as a whole, I thought everyone was really really helpful. For my stay, I had the concierge on speed dial. We used them to order a bottle of wine. We used them for dinner recommendations. And most of all, we used them to help coordinate the house car. This was one of the best amenities that this hotel has. I believe that there are 2 Escalade (6 pass max) that are there for use. We called for a pick up from Pier 39 and they arrived in 15 mins. We also requested a pick up from Union square and that took about 20-30mins. But remember, you pay for what you get. Ordering the bottle of wine cost $5 for delivery and then a fee of about $13 for ""butler service"". So instead of ordering food (and paying $25 delivery), we just ordered for pick up and I ran downstairs to get it myself. Valet parking is also $57 a night. Just beware. Other Amenities: We really appreciate the complimentary internet and breakfast. The lounge is small but we were able to find tables without problems. Plus if you wanted to take the food back to the room, they will give you a platter to carry it. There was a decent selection of pastries and bread. There was fresh squeezed orange juice and hot croissants and breakfast burritos. We were there for only 1 night so the meal was sufficient, however, not sure if they change it up daily. Otherwise it could get boring. I don't believe there is a pool or work out facility. There was a really nice patio (w/fire and chairs) to just relax and enjoy S.F.Complaints (not alot but here goes...)- In our room, there was not a lot of info about the hotel. No in room dining guide, no explanation of the amenities. Maybe because this room was not one of their typical ""hotel"" rooms...thus I was lost most of the time- No lobby bar. You have to go across to the Pub or McCormick'sThe hotel was wonderful and ""kid"" friendly. No one gave us any awkward stares or problems. I believe if we could afford it, I would love to come back and spend more time here. You definitely get what you pay for."
"I stay every summer in fairmont heritage place for many reasons : it has the best location , best service and best rooms . I always travel with my kids and in room washer /dryer help me a lot . The concierge is very helpful as well . The rooms are spacious and nice."
"We arrived at the hotel by taxi from San Francisco airport $52 exc tip!Quickly helped with all our luggage and went to check in.Very friendly and helpful staff took us on a quick walk through of the hotel and then to our room.We had booked a 2 bedroom suite and had made a request that the kids room was set up as a twin.The suite itself was very impressive, but the kids room had a double bed that couldn't be changed.We hadn't received any reply to our request about twin beds but we called reception and asked to change to a suite with a master bedroom an a kids twin - which the hotel DOESN'T HAVE!!!????We eventually had to upgrade at $200 per night extra to a 3 bedroom suite.Once we got there is was a great apartment and very well appointed - so it should be at the price!There are no restaurants in the hotel.A hot buffet breakfast is available and is decent enough although inadequate seating available and on the last day the only table we could get was filthy, obviously a child had dropped the majority of its bread and boiled egg all over the floor which hasn't been cleaned up.If you want to eat in there are menus from all the restaurants from around the square in your room which the hotel will bring to your room. But be careful - you'll be charged at $25 delivery fee for what is less than a 2 minute walk!"
"Just sat here after a five night stay and have to mention how noisy it is just when you get back to the room to relax . Our apartment is a bay view one , great views. In the square below every evening a musician sets up and plays for up to 2 hours. It's either an electric violin/ drums or electric sax . It's nice for the first 10 minutes then drives you nuts. You can't relax ! Glad to be leaving tomorrow . Staff here are excellent , accommodation high standard but the surrounding area is a bit run down around fisherman's wharf. I've never seen so many homeless people. Two other things to mention if you have teenage children not many apartments have twin rooms . The only option is an air mattress, not great when the accommodation is so expensive and one of the kids has to sleep on the floor. Secondly if you rent from an owner check the small print , no housekeeping included! "
"Excellent location, luxurious decor, large room... very good staying experience. It offers all your need, airport shuttle, babysitting/ child services, laundry, dry cleaning, a full equipped kitchen. What else you can expect? The staff are friendly. They showed us around the hotel and the room in very friendly way. More importantly, the hotel is very room-feel. Unlike most of the other hotels, the decor, lighting, all the things together.... made us feel like staying in home. I could stay in this hotel for months~~ The only thing imperfect was the breakfast. They hotel didn't offer much choice. However, when considering this is not a big hotel, it is understandable and acceptable. Overall, this is definitely one of the very best hotels I have ever stayed. Highly recommended!"
This hotel is great for families with kids as there is a flat screen in every bedroom and the house cleaners leave little chocolates on the pillows!!Also the hotel has the only room that I have stayed in that has a set of stairs
"Few places in North America have impressed me as much as the Fairmont heritagein San Francisco thanks to their management's investment in intellectual property. Getting the right people for the job is central to any apart d'hôtel. Think Citadines service apartments in London and amp their customer service hundred fold to get a taste for the kind of customer service you are in for at the Fairmont Ghiraderelli square apart d'hôtel. Whether it is the valet, bell hop or the concierge they are right up there with the folks at the Peninsula group of hotels: courteous, attentive without being overbearing and racially non discriminatory. We only had the opportunity of interacting with Jeromie who I can safely state is a star concierge. He helped out making our transportation arrangements besides recommending Gary Danko's fine dine place to us which is only like a hop skip and jump away from the property, and were we glad to take him up on it or what?!The downsides are not that many. With all due respect, breakfast is a joke with scant options available and limited seating so that the early bird gets the worm has a special ring to it staying at the Fairmont Heritage. They have efficient house keeping and maid service but it is a challenge to keep them coming knocking to your door for service as early as 8.30. Not ideal for visitors who like to have a lie-in when on holiday.We also found it impossible toconnect with the concierge services in the evening for the 4 nights we were stayingOther than that, this is a faultless property and it helps that it's conveniently located near Fisherman's wharf and within walking distance of another San Fran landmark: Lombard Street.I think I am beginning to understand where Rudy Kipling was coming from."
"We loved our stay here. As a family of 6 it provided the perfect option for us....we had a 3 bedroom suite, with a large kitchen/dining/general area. The location is spot on...Ghirardelli Square provides you with a nice sanctuary from the noise and hussle of Fisherman's Wharf, which is only a few minutes walk away. The shops in the Square are good...a couple of OK restaurants (expensive, but easy), a wine shop (good to take a bottle back to the room!) and amazing sundaes at the Ghirardelli Market shop!The staff at the hotel were great...the concierge desk was always helpful and had some good ideas for restaurants. The house car was a great service that we used several times. The car took all 6 of us, which was great. The drivers were all knowledgable and helpful. It's worth noting that this is not a ""full service"" style hotel, as the rooms are privately owned and ""rented"" out to people staying there. The services offered are full concierge service, drivers in the house car, and room service using menus from various nearby restaurants. All services provided are very good though.The Fairmont Heritage Place was perfect for us and made our stay in San Fran even more memorable! Loved it! If you have a family or large party, it's a must!"
"Five of us stayed in a two bedroom suite, which worked perfectly, including the sofa bed for my youngest. The room - or apartment, more appropriately, was impeccable - very chic, clean, and well set up. The hotel staff couldn't have been more helpful and professional. The outside terrace which overlooks Ghiradelli Square and the bay, was simply amazing. It is steps away from Fisherman's Wharf. You really couldn't ask for more - we hated to leave."
"Fantastic apartments. Wonderful staff. Town car service amazing. Nothing too much trouble. Took hotel bikes over the Golden Gate Bridge. Staff made sure we had helmets, backpack, water and maps. All recommendations were spot on. Didn't want to leave."
"Stayed here in June with our family of five. We had a two-bedroom suite and appreciated the chance to keep food in the fridge for our young kids to eat as snacks. We were within walking distance of the Aquatic Park and our kids loved playing on the beach. Walking distance to Fisherman's Wharf, Trolley, decent (somewhat pricey) places to eat. Staff was very attentive, we loved the firebowls and the pool table and board games, all worked well to keep our kids busy. Staff fixed DVD player quickly, fireplace in the living room was nice. Loved having our own balcony. The breakfast was not the best, but it wasn't terrible. Honestly, the staff was great and our kids loved the free chocolate every day. ;)"
"We stayed for 5 nights at the end of a 3 week trip to the states. We had read the reviews and were really looking forward to our stay. The apartments/rooms are beautifully appointed with everything you could need for a comfortable stay with quality linens, toiletries and appliances.We booked a one bed apartment but were given a two bed. It was located at the end of the building next to an exit/fire door, and it banged closed constantly. We realised by the end of the stay that it appeared to be used most frequently by staff, and the noise was quite annoying. The complimentary breakfast and afternoon cheese and wine reception are a nice touch, but considering the price tag this place carries its nothing special. We used the house car on a couple of occasions which was great, but its just your luck if its available or not.This was our first visit to San Francisco, and were we to return we would not choose to stay in this area again. The views of the bay are beautiful, but there's really not much happening in this area, particularly in the evening. .Fairmont Heritage Place is more of a time share establishment, albeit a very nice time share, but lacks the hub of a hotel with no real lounge, bar or meeting place with any kind of atmosphere. It's hard to put your finger on why this wasn't a perfect place to stay as it was beautiful, but we felt it lacked a certain je ne sais quoi."
"Wow. Just wow. From the moment the car pulled up in front of the Fairmont until the sad, sad moment we left, we were made to feel like the most important guests they had ever hosted. Three generations (grandma, daughter-in-law and 2-year-old grandson) shared a fantastic 2-bedroom bay view suite, including a spacious private balcony with a view to die for. It didn't hurt that San Francisco was experiencing a spate of perfect weather: clear, sunny skies with no hint of fog and only a light breeze. On day 2 of our stay we took the first Red & White tour boat of the day, and never needed the jackets we'd brought! If you've ever been to San Francisco you will know how incredibly rare that is!Our room was a great place to retreat to after walking for miles throughout The City. When we got too tired for even public transportation, a quick call to the Fairmont brought one of their friendly, competent (and, I hope it's OK to say, extremely pleasant to look at) drivers to pick us up for the ride ""home."" Of the many great features of the Fairmont the house car for free rides around town was one of the most appreciated. The rooms are spacious, with a living room (with door to the balcony), kitchen with eating area (table and chairs for 6), and two nicely sized bedrooms (both with balcony access and both with large, full bathrooms). Housekeeping is quick and thorough, although not necessarily timely -- we knew they would come twice daily, but sometimes morning and early evening and sometimes late afternoon and early evening. They made sure we had plenty of fresh towels and disposables (TP, tissue, soap, paper towels, etc.) put dishes in the dishwasher and generally did what you expect of housekeeping at a top-notch hotel.A semi-continental breakfast is provided in a common area each morning, with pastries, breads, lots of really good fresh fruit, cereal, juices, milk, coffee and tea. They also featured warm breakfast wraps but we never tried them so can't vouch for their tastiness. Everything was reasonably fresh, nicely presented and kept well stocked. We were never in the hotel in time for the wine & cheese afternoons. Despite being in a very busy, touristy area we experienced no problems with excess noise from outside (or inside) the hotel. The Fairmont is located just a block or so uphill from the bay and has a small, clean beach the grandson loved. A perfect place to watch the sunset before wandering back, making sure to get an ice cream cone from the Ghirardelli Square soda shop. All in all, one of the best trips to San Francisco I've ever taken! We will definitely be back soon"
"I rented a three bedroom and a two bedroom apartment for a family weekend and couldn't have asked for a better setup than at Heritage Place. Great location near Fisherman's Wharf with wonderful views, exceptionally friendly and helpful staff, and great rooms.The only downside I found with our stay was the relatively mediocre breakfast spread for such a costly and high profile location. I can get various eggs, waffles, and several cereals at a place like Holiday Inn, but not so at Heritage. Basic continental items only. However, just a fairly minor point."
"We had a vacation rental of a unit in the Fairmont Heritage Place in Ghirardelli Square in San Francisco. Where do I even begin? This place was... heaven! The location is amazing - literally in the old factory buildings of Ghirardelli Square, with all the shops and restaurants you could want right outside the door. Just a block up from the Bay, a few blocks away from Fisherman's Wharf, etc. You really can just walk to everything, since it's a block away from the end of the trolley line too.The bellhop met us at the front door and took the car (and unloaded it for us!) and we went inside the small but luxurious lobby and got our keys. The concierge showed us around the amenities - breakfast/afternoon wine tasting area, patio that overlooks the bay, individual business rooms (with computers to print out boarding passes for flights - very convenient), access to Ghirardelli Square shops, etc. Then we went to our room. We were supposed to be in a one bedroom, one bathroom with a pullout couch. What we got was a 2 bedroom, 2 full bathroom (5 piece bathroom each!), full kitchen, a dining area, comfy living room, modern steam laundry machines, huge closets, free Ghirardelli chocolates, big HD tv's in every room, and amazing views of the bay and Alcatraz. And this was all for $450 a night from our vacation rental!!!!!! HOLY MOLY! The beds were both king size and amazingly comfortable. We had a baby with us and requested a crib. They gave us a full size, completely safe, modern portable wooden crib, and a little kit of baby toiletries and a little stuffed animal too! Breakfast was much more than the standard continental breakfast, with lots of hot things too. Free wi-fi in the unit that was pretty fast. Our parking (which would have been $50/day) was included in the rental price! This was one of the nicest places I've ever stayed, and with location and amenities, I'd go back in a heartbeat!"
There is nowhere else I will think of going the next time that I am here.. The whole experience was too good! The staff was very very good. The rooms were perfect. The house car compensates very well for the cost of the rooms. The location could not have been better and the concierge do a lot for you too..
