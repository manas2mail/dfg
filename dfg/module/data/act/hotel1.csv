Review
A 15 minute walk to the start of shops bars etc.hotel nice n very clean…
 Only the park outside of the hotel was beautiful 
 No real complaints the hotel was great great location surroundings rooms amenities and service Two recommendations however firstly the staff upon check in are very confusing regarding deposit payments and the staff offer you upon checkout to refund your original payment and you can make a new one Bit confusing Secondly the on site restaurant is a bit lacking very well thought out and excellent quality food for anyone of a vegetarian or vegan background but even a wrap or toasted sandwich option would be great Aside from those minor minor things fantastic spot and will be back when i return to Amsterdam 
 Location was good and staff were ok It is cute hotel the breakfast range is nice Will go back 
 Nothing at all to do with the Hotel of course but people tend to Slam their bedroom doors as they leave so if you re thinking of having a little lay in just be prepared for a Slam to awake you Other than that nothing to fault at all 
 Careful they are still renovating the building and start at 8am so it suits for business people but if you want a relaxing stay the noise can annoy you 
 We had 2 different rooms here and both were duplexes with identical floorplans There was very little space and the staircase was precarious with no handrail Was kind of a pain to have to go downstairs every time we needed something out of our luggage or needed to use the bathroom 
Apart from food everything is very bad
excellent quality food for anyone of a vegetarian or vegan background 
 Terrible shower slow elevator and had to wait to long 4 it
 Everything horrible accommodation huge nose coming to my room also hearing neighbors always and very high music
 The hotel atmosphere and reception people bored to assist or answer a simple question 
 The booking had said inclusive of breakfast then turned out not to be
 Hotel is getting a little old 
 Missing the big green chair in all the photos on the web site 
 The Terrasse i was expecting more Spa is Poor Fitness is Poor Out of shape for a modern City 
 over used and not clean
 noise from the hall
 Location is pretty good Minutes away from metro 
 The driver shuttle who took me to the airport was friendly and professional 
 The staff were very friendly and helpful Close to several important sites I really enjoyed my short stay 
 Let me have early check in 
 The location was good besides that everything was absolutely terrible Probably the worst hotel experience I ve ever had 
 The staff very helpful The bed so big
 The Location was great a short walk from the main attractions and very Close to some excellent restaurants 
 Great location not so crowded and it was easy to reach Duomo Staff is pretty kind for Italy 
 I was in the hotel with my mum for two nights and we enjoyed the place a lot Breakfasts were delicious and there were plenty of food to choose from yoghurts pastry vegetables eggs cheese ham etc The staff was very helpful and kind The neighborhood was nice as well and it was easy to get to the city center by tram or metro Our room was clean all the appliances were working there was really nothing to complain about 
 The breakfast was delicious Plenty of variety on offer Was close to public transport Managed to find our way around Milan quite easily Staff were very helpful 
 The staff was extremely helpful and positive Large and comfortable rooms Very good breakfast Perfect value for money 
 The cleanless in the room We stayed at room 506 with balkony for 3 nights We asked through Booking com at the reservation time and early check in as we are smokers with my husband We got them both to give us more comfortable stay We had daily cleaning the lady were fantastic to us there was no complaints about it at all The breakfast was absolutely more than enough to start with the big walking around in the City for a long day The temperature were ok we could manage to use easily the air con The reception staff were very helpful specialy the lady with dark hair around mid age were a Pro There was no big and silly question what she couldn t aswer to us We felt like she read our mind and that s what we felt like secure We got all info about the trains dawn to Como Lake the shopping opening times etc We asked for blankets and iron board and there were in the room in no time The scene of the liquid soap in the room were nice the bathroom amenities avarage however as we used them on the daliy basis for the shower there were always replaced with the new bottle at the cleaning time which were an advantage as we didnt take any shower gel with us thinking that we should have them in the bathroom The blind on the window were very helpful as the sun came in early but it wasnt a case as we could sleep in the dark All above we would deffiniatelly come back when we return to Milano for short stay 
 personnel was polite and nice breakfast diversified the location close to center but on a very quiet boulevard it has a big supermarket nearby
 Good location direct tramway to the center close to metro station shuttle from Malpensa airport stops in 1km from the hotel Very friendly and handsome staff late departure was accepted city transport tickets at the reception very clean place

 Location Location location perfect No complaints at all Excellent Carlos from the front desk the best 
 Everything super royal stay with great breakfast buffet and location would definitely recommend this place
 Breakfast choice was abundant Perfect location good beds
 Great place to stay no issues
 Morgenmadsrestaurant
 the opening times of the bars rooftops and spa would have been handy in the hotel information left in the room 
 I can t fault this hotel at all but it will be nice when their Elemis consultants and services are running as they are not in place the moment but only a minor detail 
 Left some earrings in the room which I never got back as staff couldn t find them
 Aviary bar service a little slow but could be explained as it was a busy Friday evening
 Housekeeping knocked twice before check out time and woke me up twice
 The are some spots which need more attention while cleaning the room as for five star hotel there are places to improve 
 My second visit to this hotel and everything about it was great Staff excellent and eager to help Room and facilities excellent Would always use this hotel on visits to London now
 Excellent Service and very smart looking hotel and handy location excellent spa and bars
 The room is clean and comfortable It is a comfortable bed The shower is nice though not very powerful 
 Location close to the tube station The room was spacious and the bed was amazing I particularly liked the tablet that allowed us to control the heating and lights The hotel offers a smartphone with internet access for use during the stay The staff was kind and helpful I will definitely stay here again 
 Everything it was our wedding weekend and the hotel could not have done more for us Outstanding
 Room was a lovely size and very comfortable Great ensuite too Went to the Modern Pantry restaurant very close to hotel for breakfast absolutely delicious 
 very good hotel nice people and service good breakfast helpful in everything and for everything nice location in the finance part of london close to few metro station 
 Very clean Receptionist were helpful Restaurant staff need more training 
 Very friendly staff Lovely roof top bar 
 The hotel was very modern with high tec facilities but it was the staff that made my visit incredible Nothing was too much for them They had put gifts in my room for my special event which involved a great amount of thought and research on their part The spa was gorgeous lovely pool and Jacuzzi I can t recommend this hotel highly enough in fact I have booked to go again I wouldn t use any other hotel now when I visit London 
 Amazing welcome helpful and friendly staff great food in the rooftop restaurant with brilliant views room was massive lovely shower robe umbrella slippers swimming pool steam room sauna this hotel is second to non an experience like no other fully stocked mini bar
 The Handy smartphone you re given to use for the duration of your stay which allows you to have 3G on the go as well as being able to use it as a phone while staying in London to make any necessary calls without roaming charges was definitely a great addition which really helped us to get around As well as this the spa facilities are excellent 
 We were on a short break in London so only stayed here for two nights but will hopefully come back for longer next time We couldn t fault the accommodation as it was spotlessly clean and comfortable The staff also were very friendly and helpful 
 Bathroom party size and you feel you are floating in the bed cool hotel 3 tubes close Liverpool st takes you from soho to stansted great connection 
 The location was good especially for anyone flying in via Stansted airport or anyone travelling via Liverpool Street The bed was very comfy I especially loved that they provided a cellphone with unlimited data local calls and etc As to the hotel it is very new so that might be why but I found the staff though friendly and helpful to be quite inexperienced and slightly awkward at times 
 Fab location excellent staff and loved the hotel just a pity we didn t have time to try the new spa facilities 
 Roof top bar was lovely
 Exceptional level Of staff welcome
 Everything the Service the rooftop bar I was upgraded to a junior suite the price everything 
 More of a boutique feel with easy walking to food and sites
 Rooms were beautiful Big for Paris Elegant place Helpful concierge 
 Central location High accommodation standard
 Refurbished clean rooms light and space 
 The location the lobby
 The staff was specially kind Even though I arrived there very early they can allow me to take a rest in the room
 What a great hotel Fantastic location Super staff The largest room we have ever stayed in while in Paris Fantastic 
 The location is very convenient and hotel staffs are well trained with welcome smiles 
 The location of the hotel is very conveninet and safe 
 Quiet location walk to shops and restaurants Staff were helpful 
 Nice bathroom loved the balcony 
 Would be nice if they advertise photo rooms from this hotel 
 I just arrived at 12 30 but I could nt check in and they said it should be at 3 O clock exactly There was nothing superb but normal
 The staff at breakfast were not as helpful as they could be We came down to breakfast at 8 30 it finished at 10 30 and everything was on on offer but as it got busy food ran out and you had to ask for food to be restocked replenished bacon croissants orange juice pancakes etc Which was done eventually but Only what you asked for which meant lots of empty plates therefore less choice for later guests 
 No computers available I had to move room because I checked in and Wi Fi was not working and later TV also I had to move rooms and the new one was quite old as was the last floor 
 Some noise at night from trains under hotel not a huge issue but worth noting as some people may find it annoying Also restaurants and bars around hotel are quite expensive as you are on the champs Elyse Worth going a bit further out and finding greater value for money
 Most of the reception staff weren t that friendly rooms in the sixth floor most of them they have split bathtubs than the toilet We had to ask twice to change the room and they kept saying that we are fully booked and they didn t change it until we told them that the next guest was really noisy and we weren t able to sleep they changed the room and it was the same in regard to the bathroom rooms aren t soundproof you can hear even the housekeepers chatting early morning by the door of the room We removed everything from the mini bar but they kept filling the fridge which is not nice that they were checking the fridge though we notified them that we ve removed everything and placed them on the drawer
 Extras were expensive Free Wi Fi was very slow although option to upgrade for EUR 15 0 a day avail Water from the room mini bar was eye watering at EUR 5 0 a bottle Given the EUR 300 price I paid per night felt these should have been included as they would be at the Intercontinental 
 Room is not soundproof we could hear all the conversations of the next rooms mostly they don t respond to our request saying come down and get it there is nobody else attending the reception desk 
 I was supposed to have a 3 15 am phone call to wake me It never came I asked the night before for a Regular paris Taxi to take me to the airport When I came down the driver was already there but he spent 10 minutes trying to figure out where the airport was When I got into the Taxi the meter was already set on 15 00 Euros It was 4 00 am and there was no traffic I was told the Taxi to Orlay airport was 40 00 45 00 euro It was 55 00 and the driver locked the doors until I paid No Taxi ever did that in the many times I traveled to Paris I will never forget that I do not trust the staff who calls a private driver and the driver doesn t know where a major airport is located Shame on him and shame on your staff I will not stay there again 
 price should be fixed in pounds Stirling not changed after the booking it may be in the terms agreed but changing the price afterwards leaves a very bad taste of suspicion
 The pull out couch for our girls was uncomfortable for them 
 Ants in the room Toilet was in one room and sink on the other side of room
