Review
"So stayed here for 4 nights. Excellent base for exploring San francisco, right in the city centre, but close to the cable car, so access to fishermans wharf was easy. Very good hotel, service excellent, breakfast good if surprisingly small portions for the USA, and our room 4810 on the top floor had wonderful views of the bay, the bridge, and Alcatraz. It was also very comfortable although room to room sound proofing could have been better. Reception was being redeveloped when we stayed, once finished this looks terrific, at least the artists impressions looked terrific! Would stay here again if in San francisco in the future. Would have been excellent all round if the sound proofing in the room had been better."
"I really loved retro style of the hotel: mechanical thermostat, old fashioned furniture, leathered menus and notepads, speed elevator of 20ies and etc. Bridge to bridge suite offers exceptional view of San Francisco at any time of the day. You literary can spent more time that you have, watching this breathtaking skyline view. I don't thing you could find better place to enjoy sunrises and sunset above the foggy city. King-size bed is great, bathroom is pretty big with a tub and a shower. This place is very quiet, even if it is located in the downtown of SF. You can use terrace on 38th floor for photo sessions (on spring and summer they have sky deck opened on 40th level). Staff is extremely friendly and helpful (room service is great as well).Unfortunately, the parking is not included in the rent (unless you have paid for parking package). It is about $70 per night. You'd better use nearby Embarcadero Center Garage just 5 minutes away for $32. Breakfast is not included as well and restaurant has very few dishes for ordering. It was our wedding stay and we were treated with two glasses of sparkling wine and set of macaroons and chocolate strawberries. I wish we could have flowers or rose petals as well on the bed :)"
"From the moment we pulled up to the valet (with 7 suitcases!) the service was superb. The doorman couldn't assist us enough through the renovation. We were escorted up to the 38th level for check-in at which point Linda had advised our upgrade was successful - we had a fantastic Bridge to Bridge suite on level 45 - what a view!The suite was gorgeous, very spacious and comfortable. Rooms were clean and wifi was great. The turn down service was lovely. We didn't try the restaurant as we ventured out each day from morning till night - I wish we could have just spent a day in the room with the binoculars and that view!This is definitely be our San Fran hotel for all our visits now."
"Even with the hotel currently remodeling the entrance, this hotel was spectacular. The service from the time you arrive until you leave is phenomenal. The room was upgraded to a higher floor with an amazing view of downtown, the Golden Gate Bridge, and Alcatraz. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting San Francisco."
"We got away one night for a late Valentines weekend and decided to try the Loews. It is now our favorite luxury hotel get away in the city. Our room was a luxury king with golden gate and bay views. Absolutely stunning. Seeing some of the pix on the Loews site and TripAdvisor, we were expecting great views and we weren’t disappointed. In fact, the site pictures don’t quite do the views justice. The room was tastefully appointed and had a couch (chaise lounge) and comfy chairs for sitting back and admiring the view. The bathroom was spacious. The bed was divine. The room service breakfast was tasty, with croissants and berry danishes that were among the flakiest I’ve ever had. Service was also top notch. On check-in, grab a complimentary prosecco and hit the 38th floor deck. Currently (Feb 2018) the lobby is being renovated which makes for a somewhat awkward walk to the elevators and a little more cramped check-in experience on the 38th floor. However, you forget about that as soon as you’re in your room. Lobby renovations are supposed to be done by April. "
"This hotel is currently going through renovation, the building was the Mandarin Oriental and now transitioning to Loews. So bare this in mind if you’re looking to book! It’s dude to be completed March 2018. Having said that, the hotel is very good! Not a Absolutely mind blowing but very classy and clean! Due to the lobby renovation check in is in the VP suit on the 38 floor. Check in was quick and efficient and handled all issues or questions. Also offer free sparkling wine or coffee! Which is excellent! I had a city view room and it was fantastic view! Especially with a Californian sun rise and sun set! The bed is the comfiest I have slept in! Although I brought my own pillow as I’m fussy like that! The room service is very expensive for what it is, and also not that great quality!What also let the hotel down was that, it offers free coffee between 0530 and 0830, which is great! However, if you have breakfast and order a coffee, you pay for it?!!! Even though they have complimentary coffee just outside! Breakfast is limited and expensive! Like a coffee and waffle is around $35! Do yourself a favour and head to blue bottle coffee and have a waffle and coffee there for $12 and it’s three times better! "
My wife and I stayed here on our way up the Coast. We used to live in SF and wanted to spend a day in the City and remember why we loved it. This did the trick.The rooms have spectacular views. Even the bathroom has a long vertical window providing a view of Alcatraz while you are handling your business. The Loews Regency is a modern luxury hotel. The rooms are beautifully designed and have all the technology you will need. Beds are comfortable and the bathroom is the nicest of any hotel in which we have stayed in the City. The location is great for walking as well as the views. We were able to walk down to the Ferry building a couple of times and room service was really good. This hotel and the Fairmount are our favorite hotels in SF.
"The Loews Regency San Francisco has some of the best staff at any luxury hotel. they are absolutely fantastic. The first floor is under construction so your first impression could be challenging except that the doorman and their team welcome you and expertly guide you through the maze. In the interim the beautiful Presidential Suite is the lobby on the 38th floor complete with terrace and prosceco so you are not suffering at all. Rooms are spacious with fabulous views and terrific Wi-Fi. The temporary restaurant has lots of space between tables but is a little dark. However the food is way above average including my breakfast favorite, chicken hash. This is our go-to hotel for San Francisco."
"Great stay at the Loews SF. I was fortunate to get a bay facing room, which had a sweeping views of the bay from the Golden Gate to the Bay Bridge. Given this is in one of the top 5 tallest buildings in SF, you will not find a better view in any hotel. Turndown service and daily cleaning were very thorough. The elevators to the guest rooms were running slowly the entire time, but I believe they may have been doing some maintenance on them that week. Great stay"
Extremely pleased with our stay. The service provided from the first day to the last day (4 days) was always friendly and attentive. Definitely will consider another visit on our next trip to San Francisco.
"Every experience was beyond my expectations. From the doorman carrying my suitcase from the door all the way to reception on the 38th floor, to the friendly, fast and efficient check-in (with complimentary water or champagne!) and then the door man carrying my bag to my room. The room was amazing-comfortable bed, flat panel TV, a large desk for working, a bathrobe and slippers and the view! I had a view of the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, Coit Tower and Transamerica Building."
"Service was impeccable. The concierge went above and beyond to find unique activities (The Speakeasy!) and excellent restaurants for us. We stayed in a Deluxe Bay View room. The bed was extremely comfortable. The tub was perfect for soaking. We had lovely view of the city, the bay, the bridges, and Alcatraz. Location was convenient. And the pancakes at the restaurant were delicious (very important!). The only negative was the spa - we booked a couples massage as a last minute splurge. The massage room was freezing and the curtains were open to another building, making it impossible to relax. I would suggest finding a local spa and enjoying their services instead."
"Amazing views, spacious and tasteful room, attentive and kind staff. Despite ongoing renovations, the restaurant and bar are very good. Location is convenient and quiet on the weekend. I walked and used Uber to get around. The house car was never available when needed."
"For a very picky and neat freak person like myself, Loews San Francisco is highly recommended! Front desk staff are friendly and cordial. Love them!The doorman were always there - felt like a celebrity!Breakfast was always excellent ! Good eggs benedict and pancakes! We enjoyed our little walks to the Pier and downtown San Francisco, so convenient!And last but not the least, the View is incredible!!"
"I just finished my visit at the Loews Regency SF. There are so many hotels to choose from in this beautiful city but there were 4 reasons why I chose to stay here: ;#1 A view of the city, the water, and the sites. #2 Having a drink at the rooftop bar#3 Getting a massage in my room#4 The view when soaking in the bathtub and its decor. It was my first time traveling to SF and I was traveling alone. Off the airport, I ubered to the Loews Regency from SFO. It was about 45 mins with downtown traffic and costs $35. My driver took me down a very scenic route that led to ATT Park, Bay Bridge, Embercadero and then the Financial District. When I arrived, a Loews staff member opened my door, got my name, and my luggage and guided me to the lobby. Unfortunately, the lobby and pretty much the entire hotel was under renovations and I got to experience the staff / delivery entrance. The lobby was located on the 38th floor and the elevator was a 10 second shot straight up. I didn't feel a thing! Inside the Vice Presidential Suite is a desk and refreshments: Water, Champagne is what I remember. I was grateful to be upgraded to a Junior Suite and chose the room with the Golden gate bridge view. I was then guided up to my room and given a tour. The room was spectacular. Some may say the room is a bit dated, but I thought it was fine. The windows and the view was so beautiful. I sat on my chaise for 6 hours just staring out the window and getting a nice quiet rest. The room can be very cold because it is up so high and during winter, I had the thermos at 80 degrees and it finally felt normal temperature. The windows get very cold and closing the curtains was the only way to keep out the cold and sadly the view. So I kept one window open. The bathroom was normal except for the view! You wont be able to see it laying in the bathtub but going potty and showering will take your breath away and you are above everyone and everything- even the birds, so I doubt anyone can look in. The bed was very comfortable and not lumpy. The mirror door closet had plenty of room and there is also a seating bench by the door with more storage space underneath. The windows open outward from the bottom, kind of like a classroom and only about 6 inches for some fresh air. The clock radio was a ihome however it only accommodates Apple and I could not Bluetooth to my Samsung. There is also a doorbell which was nice and subtle. Being on the top floor, I was able to hear the fire truck and police down below and everything in the hallway as usual at every hotel. Something kept banging at the building though..maybe a bird crashed into a window..idk? but otherwise, quite peaceful. The hotel room was great. The staff was above par. They tried to accommodate my needs, even offering me the hotel car for travel within a one mile radius, and going to the store if I needed something they didnt have. Union square is .6 miles away so the car can travel there and to the Embercadero. Fishermans wharf is too far for it to go, but an uber to many places will range you around $10. Otherwise parking is valet only and costs $65. The area around the hotel is quite busy during the week day because everyone is at work. I did not see many homeless people lingering around the streets of the hotel at night, but I was advised by the staff to take the car/driver to drive me around just to be safe. Here is where I was very disappointed: There are hundreds of hotels in the area and after days of research I choose the Loews because I wanted a drink at the rooftop bar and a massage. Sadly, after experience walking through the service entrance detour, the bar and terrace being closed during the winter months, and the hotel under renovations including the spa.. it was just a very expensive room with a view. If it wasn't for the amazing staff, I probably won't not have enjoyed it as much. The hotel rates can be quite expensive so it would have been nice to get the full experience. Unfortunately, due to this very reason, I will most likely stay somewhere else but for those of you who want to enjoy a good view and great caring staff, I would recommend to you to come here after they are done with their renovations."
"Upon stepping out of our car, we were greeted by a very friendly and helpful doorman. He arranged for our car to be parked and our bags to be taken up to our room. The bellboy kindly took our bags up to level 43 (absolutely amazing views) while giving us a brief history about the hotel and the buildings surrounding it. When we walked into our very large suite, we were blown away by the views. We had views of both The Golden Gate Bridge and the Oakland Bridge. We had chocolates and strawberries waiting for us, as Loews had remembered it was our honeymoon. Not only were the bed and the pillows as comfortable as a cloud, but the sheets were soft and smooth! House Keeping was wonderful, didn't rush us and the room was always clean when we got back, with water bottles and chocolates waiting for us. Room Service was always great and the food was excellent. Location was great too, it was in San Fransisco's Financial District, so it was nice and quiet at night time. You cannot fault this hotel, the only think I would say was the bathroom needed a little renovation and the shower water pressure wasn't that great. But nothing worth complaining about. Thats the only reason I would give it 4/5. - Just me being picky."
"My partner and I stayed for New Year’s Eve weekend and had an amazing time. The hotel is top quality, all guest services are outstanding, they treated our dog like royalty and even offered a welcome package for him!"
"I have stayed at the Loews Regency in SF many times over the last few years and have always had an excellent experience. Front desk staff is always welcoming and friendly. David, the bartender at the S&P Brasserie is top notch, extremely knowledgable and will make an excellent drink for you."
"Location: Financial area that gets super quiet over the weekend (even all Starbucks within couple of blocks closed on Sundays)10-15 min walk to Embaradero, or North Beach or Union Square. Hotel: it's so understated it has no lobby ...We didn't eat breakfast in their restaurant so I can't comment on that or any other public areas. Rooms. Positives:Large rooms (by SF standards), functional roomy bathrooms and views, views and views (pictures speak for themselves)Negatives:Dated decor, paint is pealing here and there, cleaning staff left bathtub uncleaned with send in it (from previous occupants)Not a good noise insulation at all. We were awakened at 3 am because our neighbors were fighting and screaming. Hotel of course is not at fault for these people's behavior, but I could clearly hear and understand what they were saying..."
"I was interested to see whether the hotel had changed much now it's a Loews. We used to say there must be an alert system every time we left our room, when it was a Mandarin Oriental, because there always seemed to be a treat or a nice service when we returned. This isn't the case now; like every Loews I've ever stayed at there's a problem with the turndown service (I had to phone housekeeping every night of our stay to request it and on one occasion I had to call again after half an hour; on another housekeeping said we'd probably left our 'do not disturb' sign out, which we hadn't). Reception staff seem to be doubling up as data entry staff, as they always seemed to have their heads down typing furiously when we passed. The only time the heavy doors were opened for us was when Michael was on duty; the rest of the time we were blanked. Based on these criteria we had a much better experience staying at a 4* hotel on our return to San Francisco 10 days later. But .... oh, the views!! If you want to spend time in your room with your nose pressed to the window, this is the place to do it. Our bridge-to-bridge room had superb views which made it a fabulous place to recover from a long flight. The room seemed spotlessly clean (no qualms about walking on this carpet in bare feet) and it was very quiet. The furniture's seen better days but it was perfectly functional and made the room seem light and spacious. We slept well. I'd stay again, if I knew I had time to spend admiring the view. But I did feel it was less of a luxury experience than it used to be. At these prices, and in a hotel that has few guest facilities, it's not unreasonable to expect a little pampering."
"This place is amazing for the perfect stay in San Francisco! I have stayed in couple other places including Westin St Francis (2x) and I loved Loews Regency more and I am probably going to pick this place over others. I liked this place for many reasons:1) location.. it is almost in the heart of SF but still away from the numerous tourists and cars unlike Union Square and vicinity.2) staff... we got a welcome drink, she was very polite and friendly.. knew exactly what I was looking for in a room 3) this hotel has guaranteed views because the rooms start from Floor 38 (or something) and is the tallest residential/hotel tower!4) water bottles complimentary, they gave us extra bottles on 31st night which was great.. unlike Westin.. if you don’t get a room under SPG they don’t give bottles of water?? Really? I was parched on my stay with Westin!5) amazing views! "
Super luxury hotel. Top class service. Bridge to Bridge view room was spacious and provided amazing views. Some furniture showing signs of age but rooms and bathrooms are luxurious and spotlessly clean. Valet parking was always efficient. Highly recommend this hotel. 
"We have never been impressed with San Francisco hotels - either they are poor quality or over priced! We have stayed with Loews in San Diego and LA and had good experiences so we decided to book in San Fran and we’re not disappointed! Service is great, we were upgraded to a corner room with breathtaking views of city and bay and golden gate bridges. Beds are very comfortable. The location is much quieter than Union Square hotel locations. It was good value for money and is a quality hotel. Room service was prompt, the food was hot and good - definitely book high floors for spectacular views!"
"While I knew that Loews was a decent 5-star hotel, I didn't expect the level of effort the staff put into their service. I was given a free upgrade without hassle (Expedia Gold) and was given a very thorough explanation of the hotel and room. The views were amazing and the housekeeping was just as amazing. The free house car (an S-Class) took us to our dinner reservation and picked us up afterwards. In short, the service made up for the few shortcomings (that were really only temporary such as a telephone/internet outage late at night, and the fact that both the spa and the restaurant were under renovation but we were not informed prior to check-in). Will definitely consider staying again on next trip."
"This was my second stay at this hotel, and I am officially spoiled. We were given an upgrade to a room with a fantastic view. The room is so comfortable and luxurious, but understated. I felt pampered just being there. And they provide a Nespresso machine with plenty of pods (perfect for someone who is always drinking coffee). The Financial District is nice and quiet on the weekends, which I appreciate. The staff is wonderful.I live close by, but I will definitely be back for another stay in the city. "
"I had a bridge-to-bridge room, which I highly recommend. It was big, and, as advertised, had great views to the northwest and northeast. They even give you a pair of binoculars to use. The bed was fantastically comfortable. The main downside was that the thermostat was primitive, so it was hard to tell how much you were raising or lowering the temperature. But the heating/cooling system itself worked nicely and quietly. The room was also a shade underlit. The service was wonderful as well."
"I've stayed here now three times, twice as a Mandarin Oriental property and now as a Loews. This visit did not disappoint and the service and hospitality were once again impeccable.The views from this hotel are simply stunning and I was so happy that we got upgraded to a ""bridge to bridge"" room. Given it was my boyfriend's first trip to San Fran and our last night of vacation, the view was the perfect send-off before our flight home.As expected, the rooms were very comfortable, with soft linens & robes, comfortable beds and elegant, soothing decor. The service was absolutely on point, again, as it always has been. The front desk, valet & bell staff couldn't have been friendlier. Our bartender at the lobby bar was attentive & took time to chat briefly with us even though it was late on their last night of service there before moving upstairs and she and her co-workers were in the midst of packing things up. (They'll be renovating the restaurant & bar area on the main floor soon & have thus moved both to the second floor temporarily.) We ordered room service for breakfast the night before we had to check out and our order was accurate, on time and fresh.We were sad to leave but I know I'll be back for the reliable, superb hospitality."
"A high rise-hotel conveniently located in the financial district with great service and spectacular views of the city and bay. The room I stayed in was modern and clean, and the staff was very helpful during my stay."
"I scheduled a reservation through delta flights as I am a delta platinum reserve member and this hotel offers sky miles. I made the mistake of booking a superior room with a king bed rather than a superior room with two queen beds.I MADE THE GRAVE MISTAKE of going into ""manage my booking"" and hitting cancel. DONT DO THAT, you will be on the phone with delta, who will tell you that the hotel won't approve the cancellation, and Loews Hotel (who is telling the truth that they have not received any calls from Expedia) ALL DAY. My cancellation was non-refundable and my reservation could not be reinstated. I was almost out of $1200. I finally contacted the hotel directly one last time and Aysha, the reservations Manager (I believe) stayed on the phone with me, on a conference call with a representative from Delta airlines, and guided the, step by step, gracefully on how to do THEIR job for me to get my refund. I have been on the phone wit American Express and delta for hours today, but ays moved mountains for me in minutes. I am forever grateful to her and the staff at Loews Hotel, I will be exclusive with you all because of this!!!!!"
"The best views of San Francisco it was breathtaking. The room is good, but could use a little re-touch, great fitness center. The restaurant / room service needs more options but everything I ordered was very tasty. Anything that was lacking, was made up ten folds by its great service. From the doorman, the receptionist, our fabulous rooms service server, everyone was great. Specially Michael the concierge!"
"We enjoyed our stay here- it was a huge splurge for us and I spent a lot of time researching each room on this site and a few others. Service was outstanding, the view was breathtaking and the bed was sooo comfortable. However, be sure if you are offered an upgrade for additional $ that you are still getting the original amenities you expected. Our room’s view was even better with the upgrade but now we onlly had a chair instead of a couch and no view from the bathroom. I wish I had known this. Also, I don’t think that all of the rooms have bathtub views. So ask if this is important. "
"My husband and I came into town to celebrate and anniversary. When starting our trip planning, we knew we wanted to do just one night in SF before exploring off-the-grid. While Loews was at the high end of our nightly budget... even your average hotels in any central location in SF will run you extra compared to a lot of cities. With this in mind, we felt that the dollars would be best spent at a hotel with such a fantastic reputation and we are so glad we did! We sweeping views you can view in any of the photos on this page are accurate. We knew it would be even better in person, and it was. The skydeck CANNOT be missed and the service from the concierge is impeccable. They anticipated every need, to include a lift to our reservations at Water Bar from the hotel in a beautiful Cadillac sedan. Help with directions for the places we wished to walk, and a complimentary service of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries to help us celebrate our day! My only very slight negative remark would be that the bathrooms felt dated outside of the walk in shower... but I'm admittedly a little picky about vanity space, and the difference was made up 10 fold in other perks of the hotel. We will be seeking out more Loews properties & also returning to this one on our next weekend in SF!"
"Lovely friendly Hotel and the staff went the extra mile to assist in any way possible. Luxurious bedroom and bathroom, both larger than average, we were on the 52nd floor so the views of the city and the bay were fantastic."
"Modern room, great staff and cleanliness is on par. I travel a lot for work. All over the US and I'm kind of a hotel snob. I look up reviews and book my stays at nothing less then #10 or above. This hotel was ranked #3 when I booked and I don't think that's justified. Should be #1 in my book. Even the other guests where amazing. I love this place and will be back soon."
I have stayed at many hotels in San Francisco. This one stands well above the rest. The views are UNBELIEVABLE! I was excited to wake up in the morning to see the views - which changed all the time with the weather and time of day!It was our anniversary and they sent us champagne and chocolate covered strawberries (which were amazing!). When they realized our daughters were with us they came back with two more champagne glasses and another bottle of champagne and more strawberries. This is definitely our go-to hotel for San Francisco!
Best kept secret in SF. This name has changed from mandarin oriental to Loews Regency. The hotel floors are from 35-42( something like that) so it’s a smallish hotel with a lobby restaurant/ bar on the main level. Then you soar up to the high floors and get views of a new skyline of San Francisco. The staff are 5 star just like the hotel. So if your going 5 Star have a nice bundle of cash to tip the amazing staff who make you feel so comfortable and work for those tips- everyone. It a very precious experience to be treated the Loews hospitality and quality and to be grateful and tip generously!!
Stayed for three nights and thought the views were exceptional. The hotel itself is a little dated however the beds were super comfortable. The restaurant lacked any real presence as did the lobby. Would suit travellers to the financial district or those looking to just soak in the amazing views from their room. Staff were really helpful. 
"We love this hotel. We cant say enough good things about the staff. They are top notch. We arrived early and they accommodated us by letting us check in, instead of waiting to check in time. Our view is of the Golden Gate Bridge and it is spectacular. On the negative side, the room is very expensive for such a small space. Additionally, the room looks a little tired and is in need of a spruce up."
"The views, the food, and the service. These are just some of the many reasons that I would stay here at any time! I stared at the view in all my free time -- and loved the food. I had both breakfast and lunch at the hotel -- it was fabulous. And the staff is so friendly. "
"We just spent two nights here and it was fantastic. We had a Bay Bride Jr Suite. It is just a room with a sofa, but was roomy and the view of the Bay Bridge and city was one to remember. The hotel is right in the middle of the financial district. SF is pretty small for a major city so it is quick and easy to get from destination to destination. We used Uber and never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a ride. Get the highest room you can. The breakfast in the lobby restaurant was very good. We will be back the next time we are in SF."
"We had a 2 day meeting at this hotel and I couldn't ask for anything more. Friendly staff, good food, comfortable stay, very good location and awesome service! The only thing is they charge for everything and printing documents at the business was not easy. However, one of the staff came right away and helped with the printing. We are considering this hotel, again, but in New York for our next meeting!"
"We really enjoyed our 3-night stay in this hotel. On arrival we upgraded to a mini suite with a view of the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz island for just a few extra dollars each night - which was well worth it, given we were staying there for a few nights. Our room was very comfortable, clean, bright and spacious. I really loved the complimentary toiletries! All of the staff were friendly and helpful, especially the doorman (thank you). The only very slight negative was that because the hotel is located in the financial district, it is very quiet especially at the weekends with very few local establishments open so it felt a bit deserted to us. However, access to the streetcars (cabled buses) and cable cars are only a couple of blocks away, so it's easy to get to the more vibrant places such as Pier 39."
"this is a very good, 5 star hotel, in the financial district. I stayed for 8 nights during the salesforce event. Very friendly staff, good size room with separate bad, shower and large living room with bed, sofa and desk. spectacular views on the city from the room and from the skybar. Best bed I ever slept in in a hotel.Restaurant and breakfast is expensive but serve good quality food. I really recommend the hotel and will stay there again next time. However, expensive, but worth it."
"The Loews Regency San Francisco Hotel (formerly the Mandarin Oriental) is located, in the Financial District, in the top 11 floors of a 48-story tower which is reputed to be the third tallest skyscraper in the city; so wonderful views of the Bay and the City even if you risk becoming lightheaded or dizzy!. We stayed for 2 nights at the Loews and appreciated the proximity to amenities like drugstores and clothing stores, as well as being within walking distance to the pier and Union Square. Other attractions like the Embarcadero and Ferry Building are relatively close with Fisherman’s Wharf and Chinatown a little further away. The concierge team made every effort to be helpful. We plan to come back some day."
"This is perhaps San Francisco's best hotel for the views of the Bay combined with its very upscale furnishings and superb location in the financial district adjacent or walkable to Chinatown, the Embarcadero and Union Square."
I travel frequently for business and and stay in San Francisco regularly. This is my first hotel of choice. The rooms are beautiful without being overdone. The service is excellent. The staff are trained and friendly. I can't speak highly enough about it.
"My husband and I stayed several nights in this wonderful hotel. Perfectly located in the downtown area, a quick Uber drive to anyplace in SF. The staff are gracious and professional. The food is so good. We loved our super clean and spacious room and can’t wait to return. "
"We arrived later in the afternoon from New Orleans with early reservations in a cocktail bar, Bourbon and a Branch.Check-in was very smooth and when we explained that we were late for our reservations we were immediately offered the hotel car which would be ready as soon as we were, having had a quick shower. We were very impressed with this.The only thing which impressed us more was the view from our corner suite. It was absolutely beautiful- from the Golden Gate Bridge right around the Bay- this from both the bedroom and the beautiful bathroom where I enjoyed luxurious baths.Our only slight concern was there were no tea or coffee making facilities in the room which we had expected. As soon as we rang down and asked about this, a coffee machine was brought to our room immediately. As Brits who are grumpy when jet lagged, you like to be able to make a cup of coffee or tea, at slightly odd hours without ringing for it.I would like to point out that all of the staff, particularly at reception where incredibly gracious and helpful. Anton in the bar was a true star and even helped me to appreciate another brand of vodka (I was not sure this was possible). When we were tired and not minded to walk about San Francisco, we enjoyed a fantastic burger in the bar and met very interesting company and enjoyed ourselves very much.Reception were very helpful in arranging a transfer back to the airport. We were made to feel very special throughout.I would recommend this hotel to anybody seeking a luxury stay in San Francisco and would thoroughly recommend a Golden Gate Bridge Suite. We had a lovely time just watching the fog lift and the light change over the beautiful panorama with Alcatraz in the background.Truly special."
"We stayed for a long weekend in a bridge to bridge suite, which was nice but honestly not as nice as we expected. It was clean and everything was in working order however, maybe just not as posh as we expected. Unfortunately we were there during the fires in Sonoma, so our view wasn't as great as it could it been, but we could tell it would have been amazing on a clear day. The staff was fantastic - friendly and helpful. We only had one poor experience, which was with a doorman that we asked to call a taxi as there were none waiting out front. We never saw him call and he went about other business, never acknowledging us again as we waited. We ended up getting our own Uber. Everyone else however was top notch, from the front desk to the housekeeper, who was wonderful. The hotel was convenient for our excursions. We enjoyed the rooftop bar as well as the lobby bar, though we did not dine at the hotel. We were very pleased with the experience."
"This hotel is in a great location for business and pleasure. This hotel and staff make it easy for you to focus on what you are there for -- business/pleasure -- and NOT on the hotel itself. Easy ... because the service is impeccable, the rooms are sparkling clean and comfortable, and all the amenities you need are present."
"My first stay at this hotel - then a Mandarin Oriental - was in 1991. For the next dozen or maybe 15 years I was a guest, on average, once or twice a year. The property had become slightly dated over time, but still always a great experience. Some years went by, and my travels in the area usually had me camped in Palo Alto, so it wasn't on my path anymore. The Mandarin was deflagged I guess a few years back, and became a Loews. I like the Loews chain, and stay in their NYC location from time to time, so decided to give it a try. It's sort of a shell of its former self. Lobby bar and surrounding area are not nearly as inviting as they once were; a bit antiseptic, not particularly inviting, and definitely not a place to plop down in oversized chairs to meet with someone. . Functional, but not likely the first place you'll choose to meet with people while in town. Perhaps serviceable for a breakfast. The rooms have fantastic views. Some of the very best in SF. This of course has not changed. And their 'skywalks' are breathtaking, especially at night. No matter how often you walk through, it's always delights. Furniture and set up is dated and a bit rundown. It's not bad, just well beyond its expected life as room furnishings in a luxury hotel. Some things don't work, like lamp switches, a drawer handle or two... that sort of thing. The bathroom was clean and functional, though the shower head spat out a minimal amount of water. That often happens with the legally-required low-flow heads they're required install these days, so it's acceptable.The bathtub looked dirty; I didn't give it try. A shame since it's smack next to floor-to-ceiling glass with some of the best views you will ever see.The closets are from the 1980's. I don't spend a lot of time thinking about closets, so, whatever. Just pointing out a theme. In the end, if you aren't that familiar with the Loews brand, but are expecting Four Seasons, Penninsula, Mandarin Oriental, Fairmont, RC, etc., level accommodations, think again. As it compares to, say, Le Meridien down the street? Certainly the views are 10x better at the Loews."
Solid hotel well located in the financial district.The service was always very helpful and friendly. Room (4006) was a little outdated but always clean and had a magical view from Oakland Bridge to Golden Gate Bridge.Tough this is not a hotel with a huge lobby and a busy bar. If you're looking for this you might choose another hotel.All in all a pleasant stay. We would come again. 
"With so many hotels to choose from, the Loews Regency San Francisco was a great choice. It was an awesome location with amazing views of the Golden Gate Bridge and the Bay Bridge. Check in was easy, room was very clean, just a little on the small side, but the bridge to bridge view made up for the small room. Bathroom was very nice. We even used the complimentary car one night to take us to dinner. Room service was fast and the food was pretty good. If we ever return to San Francisco we would definitely stay here again."
"Great location, spacious rooms on top floor and very friendly and helpful staff, particularly the concierge. Even after only an hour the staff knew our names and greeted us each and every time by name no matter who was on duty. You can step out of the hotel and feel safe. Very close to beautiful shopping and landmark buildings. Delicious breakfasts served in stylish restaurant. I noted young children in the hotel who were very well behaved and seemed to be well catered for but I would associate this hotel more with couples and professionals than with young familiesWe would definitely return. Loved, loved San Francisco!❤️"
" I stayed at this property in May and it was a perfect experience. As a traveler who is on the road 80 nights a week, I loved the champagne a check in in the pampered service throughout my visit in May.  My visit last week with my family was disappointing. I bragged about this hotel with a great check and experience and the wonderful views on the upgraded room. The check and experience was average like you did at the Hampton Inn. The Bellman were all very nice and attentive. The concierge was great although he booked a house car that didn't come for 20 minutes as we stood outside in the chili evening air until I called my own Uber. I had some heated words with the on duty manager and I thought she would've done something nice for us once we return from a dinner. Nope.  I was also disappointed that two days before they sent me a note that I could get the upgraded suite I wanted for an extra $297 per night. Given that we have an exchange student, I thought those those awesome to have the extra space. However, at check-in they told me that was wrong and I didn't have it  I also stayed at the Omni right around the corner during my same visit last week. They gave me an upgraded sweet, sent up champagne, and it was an awesome experience for 300 hours less per night. "
"Fantastic bridge to bridge views. Very high standard of service. Concierge very helpful with great restaurant recommendations. We had a Bridge to Bridge King Room on the 40th floor. Rooms do not have coffee/tea making facilities, they will deliver a coffee maker to your room free of charge if you ask. Food was beautiful in the restaurant downstairs for Breakfast and lunch."
"I’m so glad we booked the Loews Regency San Francisco for our anniversary getaway. The staff at the hotel was top notch, and made us feel special every minute of our trip. We splurged on the bridge to bridge room and the view was stunning. The concierge was attentive and handled everything flawlessly. The bell staff and doormen made us feel welcome and special. The location of the hotel was great...Very simple to ride the iconic cable cars, or walk to restaurants or for coffee. I highly recommend this hotel. The customer service was impeccable. Rarely seen in today’s society."
"The Loews Regency offers THE best views of San Francisco. All guest rooms are on high-level floors, so the city views are stunning. Everything about the property is 5-star -- from the gorgeous rooms, fantastic amenities and delicious room service to the location, world-class staff and lovely restaurant/bar/communal spaces."
"My wife and I just wanted to get away for a quick weekend in the city. We met some friend who were recommended Loews Regency Hotel and we were not disappointed. The views are spectacular, the rooms are well appointed and the staff friendly. Will definitely come back. "
"We stayed in the bridge to bridge suite and were endlessly fascinated by the incredible views.Easy walking distance to a dozen Michelin star restaurants and many other stand out eating spots (we stayed for a month so we for sure know where to eat locally).Very warm and gracious staff, always eager to help.Crisp, clean, lovely rooms and public areas. Good elevators and super fast room service with excellent quality food.We loved everything but did find that the off the lobby dining room could be improved by the addition of a more hands on manager."
"This is fourth time over the last couple of years that my wife and I have spent a long weekend at the Lowes Regency. We have not been disappointed on any of our visits to this hotel. Great location, amazing staff, wonderful service by the concierge who set us up with an amazing dinner reservation, and of course the rooms are outstanding. We were in the Golden Gate Bridge Suite, which has amazing views. "
"I stay in a lot of great hotels - Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, Intercontinental Hong Kong, Mandarin Oriental, Wynn Tower at the Wynn, etc. - and generally in suites. This was the first time that I've stayed in a Loews.My stay did not leave me with the impression that the quality of service or the nature of the hospitality provided by Loews puts them in the tier of the other hotels in that list. *No one* should consider rating this as the #5 hotel in San Francisco.a) No one was able to serve breakfast to us (in our room or the dining room) before 6:30 AM. This is a West Coast business hotel, guys - anyone with a flight before 9 AM out of SFO that wants to eat breakfast in the hotel can't do it. b) When I asked Michael the concierge if we could have room service at 5:00 AM he seemed totally mystified by the request. (Clefs d'Or, indeed!) He didn't know when the pastries would come, when the kitchen would really get started, whether we could even really get coffee for sure, or even who to speak with to get the answers. He stammered over all of it, kind of made a phone call, and sort of shrugged. We spent several thousand dollars at your hotel in two days and the best your front desk hospitality could manage was ""you should probably figure out a plan B."" *Literally* ""you should probably figure out a plan B."" Huh? Michael didn't even have a copy of the room service menu at the concierge station. Huh?c) OK, so you have decided that you don't want to serve breakfast customers before 6:30 AM and your concierge doesn't know how to help luxury travelers. I get that. Maybe there's a 24-hour option for cold food? Oh, sorry, no - the ""overnight"" room service menu was entirely inadequate. It was, in fact, so forlorn that I almost took a photo of it. YOU HAVE TWO KINDS OF SALAD ON A SIX ITEM OVERNIGHT MENU. Who on earth wants a green salad at three in the morning? There was a turkey sandwich on the menu which would undoubtedly have come out of a package and have been microwaved. Yuck. Gross. Silly. Stupid. Get the picture?d) There were long black hairs in the shower basin during my first shower. I don't have long black hair.e) There were stains and watermarks on the bed frame - oooh, gross.f) The finish on the wood in the minibar and the desk was obviously old and crummy and was missing in some areas. Not first class. If you're going to buy the Mandarin, at least change out the furniture. Laughably, the minibar had two totally empty drawers. Huh? I was so mystified by that I took a picture and have included it in my review. g) A double espresso to my room was $18 and change. When you stay in a Deluxe Suite at the Intercontinental Hong Kong in Kowloon, they have an espresso machine in your room. Even modest hotels at a global standard have a hot water heater in their room and some instant coffee. You? Zilch. Did you take the chance to add some of the new Blue Bottle instant coffee to the room, since you're right in San Francisco? Nope. Your hotel is a smash-and-grab money generation operation, and little else.I noticed but won't particularly complain that the fruit bowl by the elevator was allowed to run out - or that the chicken hash served in the morning didn't match the recipe that was presented in the breakfast menu. While you re-did the main room in the junior suite in tasteful blues and creams, you left the 1980's pink marble buildout in the bathroom. (Check out the Four Seasons in Shenzhen - really, actually, almost any nice new hotel in the world - for a better way to treat a bathroom. If you want luxury travelers to return, you have to invest in details like that.) Your website was programmed by someone that doesn't know how to use Chrome's Autofill feature - the fields don't line up with Chrome so I had to re-enter things (name, address) that shouldn't have to be re-entered. The ""state"" dropdown only recognizes the first keystroke, and it does so in funny ways. This is 2017, and there's no excuse for your website programmers getting in the way of ecommerce.Overall, the feeling of the hotel was more like a stop-and-rob in Las Vegas where everything costs you dearly - not a posh, sensitive retreat in the sky in beautiful downtown San Francisco. The view is wonderful. I loved the hotel when it was the Mandarin. All of the things combined don't indicate that I had a bad day at the hotel - bad days happen and I think that I'm sensitive to them. That chain of problems indicate that the hotel doesn't have a direction and that the hospitality tone for the business is inadequate and/or corrupt. No part of this experience felt ""luxury"" and no part of it is worth repeating.It will take a lot of getting your act straight before I would ever considered staying here or another of your properties again. This hotel is thoroughly not recommended for luxury travelers."
"I have stayed around SF many times and the Loews Regency is my favorite hotel, Easily the best view, calm, and quiet. I must say that the beds are extremely comfortable and made for pleasant nights sleep. "
Missing the other hotel!Stunning views and location make this hotel still worth checking out although the decor is tired and furniture very basic. Quite frankly we miss the mandarin oriental which was what this used to be with its elegance and old world style. 
"I got in early and asked to leave my bags in their closet while I attend meetings during the day. The staff advised that my room was ready to check in, which allowed me to hang my suits and get myself organized before starting the day.I also went for a run in the morning and the staff gave me a banana at 5:30AM before my run and a water upon my return. The amenities were of high quality. The very friendly and attentive staff is the reason for the 5 star rating."
"Check in took about 2 minutes - very professionally handled and straight-forward. The lobby is small, has wifi guest access, and a well managed restaurant. Ordered Eggs Benedict one morning and it arrived minutes later with perfectly done eggs - always tricky for a busy team to handle. The rooms start on the 38th floor - if you want a good view, you'll likely want a room on 40 or higher to avoid a railing and balcony outside your window. The view is exquisite, however, and you can easily see Golden Gate as well as Alcatraz and the harbor area. The room itself is comfortable, with a good sized bathroom. The HVAC system is quiet and highly efficient. The bedding is very comfortable and the room is quiet. You may wish to ask for a room without a connecting door to avoid any noise from the adjoining room. My neighbors were quiet but I could hear an occasional sound from time to time. There are two elevators handling the hotel, but they are fast and waiting time was never excessive. Overall, a very pleasant stay at a hotel with a highly professional and accomplished staff."
"We stayed at the Loews Regency for a long weekend (25th wedding anniversary). This hotel is amazing! They made us feel ""at home"". This was our first stay at this hotel and we will certainly return! Great location, outstanding staff and service that is truly remarkable. We stayed to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. The hotel sent up champagne and chocolates (so thoughtful)! Everyone called us by first names and it was as if we had been to this hotel many times. So incredible to receive such care from everyone at the hotel. I would HIGHLY recommend! "
 This is an outstanding hotel in the San Francisco area . My wife and I were extremely impressed on the professionalism and expertise of the staff ! They met our every need! The restaurant was absolutely wonderful ! They even offered a hotel car to take us to dinner ! Five stars for this one !
"First experience at this chain and wasn't disappointed. I'd made a request for a room away from the elevator when booking and know this is never a guarantee. Bree at the front desk accommodated this request by upgrading me, which I wasn't expecting. The room was nicely decorated, large and clean. We had great views of the city and the GG Bridge. The only complaint was the slow service at the restaurant for lunch, but the excellent service by the rest of the staff made this easy to overlook. Would definitely stay at this hotel next time in SF."
"Very nice ,clean ,friendly hotelGreat location.Good food though restaurant atmosphere is little boring.Nice view.There are only 2 elevators , unfortunately one was malfunctioning so there was long wait ."
I was in town for a few days and knowing the back to back schedule I wanted a central location. First time to stay in Loewes and the best thing was the staff and their warm welcome. I felt as if I was a regular and the room was an excellent size and the grand city view was dazzling. Great for a business trip and certainly will go back
We stayed three nights at the hotel and were treated like royalty!! The service was amazing! Everyone bent over backwards to cater to any need you have. We stayed in a room with a view of the Bay Bridge and it was fabulous!We could also see Alcatraz from our room Beds were very comfortable. Will stay here again!
"We stayed for 3 nights at the Loews. It was conveniently located on Sansome (with the popular Blue Bottle Coffee just opposite the hotel) with amenities like Walgreens nearby. Amazing views of the Bay and the City from the hotel room. It was my family's first time in San Francisco and it was a really comfortable stay. We would like to commend Emmanuel (front desk) who was very efficient during check-in, especially after a long flight from Singapore. I would definitely come back to Loews again!"
"We stumbled upon Loews after leaving the Kimpton Buchanan following a bad experience there. We could not have been more happy with our change of hotels. From the moment we called about availability through checkout, the experience was amazing! The views are obviously phenomenal, but it was the customer service that put it over the top. When we arrived, we were each offered a glass of champagne and treats for our two small pups. Housekeeping came right away and gave food and water bowls (and more treats plus bottled water) for our pups and, when housekeeping came later to clean the rooms, left puppy toothbrushes for the pups. Little details that went a long way! The rooms were also lovely, and the bar downstairs was so cute (and had great wine selections with yummy snacks that came with the drinks). It is close to everything, and was such a lovely experience! We will definitely be back. A great stay with or without pets. Thank you Loews for a great weekend!!!"
Our bathroom was very dirty ( like it hadn't been cleaned from the previous people that stayed there The Ac didn't work properly in the room and nonexistent in the lobby and restaurant ... when we talked to front desk the response was that there was noting they could do about it at that point 
We are here at the hotel for 5 day for a wedding. I chose the Lowes because I stay frequently at the Lowes in NYC and have always been delighted by the serviceThe service here in San Francisco is at the same high standard. A few examples . We are here during the worst heat wave SF has ever been. Temperatures in the 100's. The first room we were in the ac wasn't working as well as it should. Immediately we were moved to another room and upgraded. I had purchased from the adjacent liquor store a very nice bottle of wine. When I went to open it the cork screw broke leaving the auger in the cork. I took it down to the bar and the bar tender opened it for me then the hostess took it to the kitchen and filtered it through a coffee filter to catch any small bits of cork. So kind!Then because of the extreme weather our touring plans has to change. Dean the concierge was so helpful. He got a wonderful driver for us and we had a beautiful tour of the city. He made all of our dinner reservations for us with great recommendations.At the last minute we need to have our hair done on the Sunday of Labor Day weekend. Brian the concierge obtained a hairdresser to come to the room on Sunday morning. She did a beautiful job. Brian went above and beyond to get someone for us on Sunday morning with very little advance notice. All done with warmth and graciousnessThe entire staff is devoted to the well being of each guest. They are warm and welcoming and make you feel very well cared for.I am delighted I chose the Lowes for our trip and I made the decision based on the wonderful experience I have in the NYC hotel
"I found the staff at the Loews in SF to be outstanding and I would stay here again when I'm back in SF.The whole staff made me feel welcomed, the service I received was above and beyond what i expected,the staff really did a great job."
"Stayed in a ""Bridge to Bridge View"" Room. As the name implies it offers a great unimpeded view from the Golden Gate to the Bay Bridge, with Alcatraz and the Transmerica in view to complete a great photo. The room was clean, spacious and well-appointed with modern clean furnishings.The hotel itself is well kept. Small, unimpressive lobby but neat and well done for the size. The staff is top-notch, all encountered were friendly, helpful, professional etc.Room service was good. Nice selection, delivered in time, correctly and cleanly (all items covered). Easy check-out. As with every hotel in the city the valet cost is outrageous ($60-70/night). While this is a great hotel, you have many similar options at this price point and may enjoy another bigger property with different amenities, decor etc. This is more of a city business hotel than otherwise. I would return again but would not go out of my way to book first."
"Anthony and Grace went out of their way for me and my bride on our wedding day! All greatly appreciated! Thanks Guys! Totally a 5 star place! The only place to stay when you are in the city! Amazing views, great service, awesome rooms! What more could you ask for? "
"Beautiful hotel, we definitely plan on visiting the Lowes Regency again. It's quiet and very comfortable. We love feeling as if we are in a condominium not a hotel room. A very accommodating environment. "
"We stayed at this fabulous hotel back in 2012 when it was the Mandarin Oriental and we never forgot the incredible views from our bridge-to-bridge room. So, when we decided to elope in San Francisco we knew that we had to stay at the same hotel, now named the Loews Regency. After considering several locations for the ceremony, we decided to get married on the enormous deck of the bayview terrace (presidential) suite with the most breathtaking views of San Francisco ! It’s the perfect setting for a small outdoor wedding and the views of the city and the bay are amazing ! This is probably the only hotel where you can clearly see Alcatraz, Coit Tower, the Bay Bridge, The Transamerica Pyramid, and the fog rolling in across the Golden Gate Bridge ! If you love a room with a view this hotel is a must stay ! We can’t say enough wonderful things about the hotel, the food from room service (best creme brulee ever), and the entire staff who were all amazing ! This is truly a world class 5 star hotel and we could never imagine staying anywhere else in San Francisco.Special thanks to Sage McRae, the Loews Regency events planner, who helped us with every step of the wedding planning, and Clane Gessel, the best wedding photographer in San Francisco."
"Husband and I were in town for one night and we thought, well, lets splurge on a bridge to bridge king room. When we arrived at 3:23pm, we were told that our room was still in the process of being cleaned and that they would offer free dinner or drinks until it was ready. We graciously accepted the drinks (had plans for dinner) at the hotel bar. While at the hotel bar , probably 5 minutes in, a lady from the hotel came over and said they upgraded our room from the bridge to bridge king to the bridge to bridge suite. We were shocked--- and excited! We are not fancy by any means. When we got to this room-- we truly squealed! It was beyond beautiful with views of Alcatraz, Bay Bridge, and Golden Gate Bridge. Two bathrooms, one beautiful bed and numerous couches. Two tvs! Also, every time we left, we had cleaning service. Knowing that, I would have probably asked for no service but they went above and beyond. I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
"Wonderful staff. Clean, comfortable rooms. Breathtaking views. Room service delicious. We go to San Francisco 1-2 times a year & tried many hotels over the years. Found Loews last year & now won't go anywhere else!"
"The room was very large and clean although it looked a bit dated. My only tiny gripe was that I wish the shower pressure was better. However, the location is excellent and all the service I received was impeccable. "
"We had the opportunity to stay here this past weekend for a couple of nights. As others have mentioned, the views are incredible and the location is great for walking to much of what the city has to offer. But, we had a few interesting interactions with the front desk that left much to be desired for this level of hotel. Also, the room was very dated and needs updating. I am forgiving of normal wear and tear in a hotel room, but the furniture was stained and broken, carpet was stained, and even the curtains were damaged. They need to improve standards to remain a hotel of choice in the city."
"This hotel was the best experience I had in San Francisco and MUCH better and welcoming than the Fairmont. From the beginning when I was greeted and brought inside it was very warming, welcoming and so attentive. Linda behind the desk was fantastic and so accommodating. We even got there very early and were able to get a room. ON the 42nd floor and the view was GREAT, could see Alcatraz from the room, the Bay, and the Golden Gate Bridge. Binoculars are in the room to see all the surroundings is a nice added touch. Bathroom is BIG and spacious, shower and a tub, and slippers and robes very plush. Bedding is also fantastic, comfortable and a great sleep. Don't make the mistake and make this your go to hotel in SF!"
"No doubt that it is one of the most expensive hotel in the city but pales against the other hotels that could be cheaper and at a better location especially those along Market Street. Although, it was built and opened as a Mandarin Oriental, clearly, the facilities are not quite MO. I chose a Golden Gate view and of course it comes with a premium. I would discouraged you to reconsider as the Golden Gate would like a pin hike from your room and half the time it is not visible due to the natural fog that envelopes that area so often. Give a Loews brand property and the high rates, one would expect basic necessities such as bedroom slippers readily available, regretfully none. Did not bother to call given that it was just a 1 night stay. Shower room size was generous but the absence of a hand held shower option makes cleaning other areas of the body was difficult. The heat lamp in the bathroom was a sheer waste of energy and frustrating. You will need to turn a full knob on timer to activate the heating lamp that just last only 15 minutes and is insufficient to heat up the bathroom. Fitness Center was adequately equipped. Dining choices are very limited in comparison to The Palace. Check in and Check out experience from a guest relations and efficiency point of view is way above The Palace. "
Everyone at this hotel knows how to excel in Customer Service. They demonstrated a very high level of customer service that few hotels today achieve. Highly recommend this hotel. Good location great views of the city!
"The hotel is in a really convenient location, very handy for the subway. Breakfast options were great, although the servers were so stretched it was a little slow at times. The highlights were the great gym and the fantastic view of the bay from our room."
"Ok, the view from 46th floor over the golden gate, Alcatraz and bay bridge did put us in a very good mood, but I have to say this hotel really ticked off many of those small boxes. The hotel staff was very service minded and they really made our stay in San Fransisco fantastic. I give Loews in San Fransisco my highest recommendations to everyone who enjoys true 5 star service hotels, they are a benchmark for other hotels!"
"My wife and I met up at the Loews Regency for the weekend to celebrate my birthday. I chose the Loews because of its magnificent views and excellent reviews and it certainly didn't disappoint. As a splurge, I booked a Bridge View Junior Suite (a corner room on the 41st floor) which had a breadth-taking view of the city Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, Coit Tower, and the Transamerica building (as we found out, cloudy SF days CAN mess up the view though) . The room is very nicely appointed with a small sitting area and the bathroom has a tub with a huge window so you can take a relaxing bath while viewing the city below!The service is equally out-of-this-world. The staff is very friendly, efficient, and attentive and they made us feel really special. One night we even had the hotel car (a beautiful black mercedes) take us to the restaurant! The rooftop deck is kind of fun and has a really cool view but it got a bit cold on the afternoon that we were there. Overall, one of the best hotel experiences I've had in a LONG time. A bit on the pricey side (it IS SF, after all) but I would definitely stay at the Loews if you can afford it, celebrating a special occasion, or on the company dime!"
I stayed here for 5 days and I loved every minute of it. Everything about this hotel is amazing. The staff make you feel like a VIP. The food is delicious. The hotel and view from both sides is gorgeous. The rooms are beautifully designed and homely. This hotel is an excellent home away from home.
"Great service, great room! I loved everything about my stay; very helpful staff and everyone was very accommodating. Traveling with a pet and the staff was always sure to acknowledge both me and my dog which I thought was very nice. Very comfortable bed!"
"It was our first night in San Francisco and we couldn't have wished for a better start to our 18 day road trip around California. As it was our 20th Wedding Anniversary the Hotel had left champagne and chocolates in the room which was a lovely thought. We had a room on the 41st floor that had views all around the bay - Coots Tower, Alcatraz, Golden Gate Bridge and Harbour Bay Bridge to name but a few sights. It really was a beautiful Hotel and when we visit San Francisco again we would definitely stay here. We mustn't forget to mention ITC Luxury Travel in Chester who booked this for ."
Family wedding. Loews Regency is an amazing hotel with superb accommodations and impeccable service. The wedding was perfect in every way! This is now my favorite!The staff thought of everything. They went the extra mile without being asked and always with a smile!
I had a wonderful stay. Michael and Brian went out of there way to help me out in two situations that was above and beyond the call of duty. I so appreciate the attention to detail and help. I would definitely come back just know they were there.
"This is our favorite SF hotel. Lobby is at ground level. Discreet with adjacent dinning area and bar. Comfortable area. Not large, great food. Rooms begin on 38th floor and the top is the 48th. Hotel is on top of office building facing north and south. Excellent views. Hallways are connected by glass. Get a bridge to bridge or SF Gate room. Luxurious, quiet and wonderful staff."
"Had a bridge to bridge room, can't get the view out of my head. Feel like it had to be a dream. On top of the world view. Room very nice in all respects. Twice a day upkeep a little much. Don't know what the protocol for tipping is since different people show up. If I was rich would be no problem but my son-in-law paid for room. Over all I hope he takes me back for their anniversary! "
You will definitely get what you pay for excellent service amazing customer service . Beautiful views gorgeous hotel I wish I could give a five star plus rating . I was traveling from Las Vegas to San Francisco and then to Atlanta my flight from San Francisco to Atlanta was canceled so I told my wife we already here so we better have a good time. This hotel was amazing I will definitely go back soon.
What a lovely experience!! I can't say enough about the service you receive ! The room was prestine with a beautiful view and high end products! The only advice I would give is the restaurant is priced high and offers nothing more than ordinary. I most definitely would stay here again!
I stay here at least 10x a year. The staff and the hotel are always exceptional. The rooms are fantastic even the smallest rooms are spacious and the views are the best in the city. I would highly recommend the Loews for business or leisure travelers. 
"After a loooong flight we were welcomed with big smiles and cheery hellos. A mix up with the e-upgrade led us to only have beds for 3 of the 4 of us for the first night which wasn't great but finally got sorted the next day. The views from the 43rd floor were amazing!Michael the concierge was so knowledgable and looked after us well. The location was great, I don't think staying in the Financial District was a bad thing but be prepared for the number of homeless, which saddened us.Food and drinks were good, if we went back we would stay here again! "
"Overall and excellent stay! Wonderful staff, service and experience! Great views from the rooms and the pop-up bar on the 40th floor. I would suggest to include tea and coffee making facilities readily available in the room. I was surprised this wasnt the case. Would definitely return!"
"Stayed at the Loews Hotel for a long weekend in San Francisco and had a relaxing time during my stay. I arrived before check-in time and my room wasn't yet ready, so the hotel held my luggage until it was. The front desk was great in accommodating and making sure to notify me once the room was ready; they were able to get the room ready even before check-in time. Location-wise, the hotel is in the downtown area. There are a couple of stores (i.e. CVS, 711, etc.) nearby, though many close early and on weekends since this area tends to cater towards working people. You can walk to Chinatown from here and also get quite a scenic view once you climb up the hill. Fisherman's Wharf is about a 10 minute drive. Overall, the location is pretty good and the area is pretty quiet. The people working the door were great and friendly. They were quick to offer any assistance with my luggage and even a bottle of water when I headed off to a tour. They also made sure that the tour bus I was waiting for was the correct one. The room I stayed in was amazing. It was a bridge to bridge room and the view was outstanding. I could clearly see much of San Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge (when the fog cleared up) and part of the Bay Bridge; the room I was staying in did have the bridge slightly obstructed, but you still could see a good portion of it. The room itself was pretty huge with a lot of space to sprawl out. The bathroom was pretty luxurious as well since it had both a bath and a shower; note that the soap, shampoo and the conditioner they give are very nice sized (TSA-friendly) and didn't dry out my skin. The bed itself was quite plush and had just the right amount of firmness. I didn't hear any street noise being so high up nor any noise from any of the room neighbors. One thing is that because I was staying below the Skybar lounge, I suspect people could look in to the room when the lounge is open; personally, I closed the curtains. I did try room service and the food I ordered was delivered quickly and tasted pretty good. Food price itself wasn't outrageous, however, the service charge is kind of high (though it is notated clearly on the menu). One thing I wish to an extent is if the food menu could have been expanded, the menu was somewhat limited for dinner; their breakfast had much more options.Overall, my stay at this hotel was outstanding. It provided me great rest and relaxation. I wouldn't call this a value hotel since the cost is relatively high compared to others in the area. However, for a luxurious time in San Francisco and a getaway, I would highly recommend."
This was my third time staying in San Francisco and the second time at the Loews. I absolutely love this hotel. All staff is always super friendly and the room service is prompt and delish! Sometimes room service is the fastest and most convenient way to dine. Food was delivered hot and set up quickly! The rooms/bathrooms are always clean and the beds are very comfortable. 
"I loved this hotel! The views and amenities were incredible! I want to return with my family in Nov but they can't accommodate a family of 5, that's the only downfall. Location and service were perfect!"
I stayed in the Golden Gate view suite and the views are outstanding what I love the most is that each window can be opened so you can stick your head out and look straight down 800 feet it's really mind blowing !! plus I loved the fresh air I even had a huge picture window over the bathtub that I could open and sit in the warm bathtub and look down at the view it was really really crazy. The room was actually cleaned and organized every night while we were gone and the customer service was the best I've ever received - and we've been around the world. A once in a lifetime experience to get a true feeling of the views of San Francisco. Very expensive yes worth it yes.
"Stunning views, incredibly helpful and polite hotel staff and a great location. Was pleasantly surprised and will stay here every time. Stayed at another expensive hotel up the street and this experience was far better!"
"We took the cable car to Nobb Hill and found beautiful, old hotels, with plenty of style and character. The Fairmont was beautiful. Loewes and the Fairmont were not in the same league. The nightly Tarif was exhorbitant. Had just travelled through Bancouver, Wiebec City, Washington and paid less for significantly better hotels. Wouldn't recommend."
Stayed for one night on our anniversary and the views from our room were the best we have had in San Francisco. The Staff were all top notch and very helpful. Will definitely be back for another stay!
My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Loews Regency. The view from our suite on the 39th floor was nothing short of amazing! Everyone we encountered was pleasant and helpful. We were especially surprised to find champagne and chocolates and a happy anniversary card. The staff went above and beyond to make our stay special.
"I believe that this hotel used to be part of the Mandarin Oriental hotel chain. The accommodations are exquisite, roomy, clean, and quiet. The service is top notch. The hotel staff greet you in the hallways and everyone is concerned with your needs. I will return to this hotel every single time I am in San Francisco. Thanks for everything Loews!"
"Our room was upgraded for no particular reason and it was amazing: two windows overlooking the city and the Bay Bridge. The room was really a mini suite that was elegantly furnished and deliciously comfortable. I made a passing remark to my husband when the room was upgraded that karma was on our side during our anniversary weekend, and next thing we know; viola! champagne, chocolates and chocolate covered strawberries arrive at our door. The staff was friendly and professional throughout and this was by far the best overall experience we've ever had...and we are avid travelers. I'll always stay at Loews Regency when in SF."
"The hotel is certainly expensive but is commensurate with the experience. The hotel, which occupies the top 12 (or so) floors of a 50 story building, offers nice furnished rooms (carpet stains not withstanding in my most recent stay) with nice views. In my most recent stay, I was on the 38th floor and had OK views that were not quite as nice as the views I had from rooms in 48 / 49. Overall, service is excellent. From getting out of the taxi, to check in, room service and turn down, the staff is professional and is very friendly and responsive.However, other reviewers liked the hotel dining but I had a different experience. Breakfast was good, but the service spotty (I didn't realize that placing an order could be so difficult, even with prompting) and I had no idea a hamburger could ever taste so bad that even after running a half marathon, I couldn't bring myself to eat more than a few bites.Overall, the hotel is fine, but for the money, other hotels offer at least the same value without the dining complications I had."
They allowed pets!! They even have special offerings for pets which is nice to see. That's a win for us. Their staff gives great service and we've never had a bad experience here. We've stayed at this hotel 4 times in the past few years and its consistently been good. 
Delicious breakfast in the cafe. The omelette and avocado bread were made with fresh ingredients and generous portions. Coffee and tea were tasty and toast Came with small jars of jam. It's a bit pricey but delightful getaway from downtown buzz. 
Hands down you will not find a better view in the city. The rooms don't start until like the 38th floor so you can't go wrong. 5 minute walk to a Bart station....15-20 walk to many other points of interest. The staff rocks! Everyone was very kind..super helpful. I never heard the housekeeping staff knocking on doors in the morning which was a pleasant surprise. Oh and last but not least visit the sky deck...it is a must see!
"Our room had a gorgeous view and I could almost touch the Transamerica building out our window. The staff addressed us by name and were welcoming in each aspect of the hotel.The concierges were most helpful and we used the hotel's car service which was very nice.Sometimes hotel's restaurants are not good, but this restaurant was top notch. I had pork chops for dinner which where brined and created a moist chop. Breakfast with the eggs benedict and crab was loaded with fresh crab and tasty hollandaise sauce. I would love to return to the hotel for another luxurious stay."
"We had a one night stay here. Concierge was exceptionally helpful and check in was very smooth. Room was of a really good size and well equipped as you would expect of a hotel of this standing. Well stocked bathroom and minibar, and even a ""couples kit"". Worth noting that our Bay view room was stretching that point, we looked directly out into the side of an office building. To catch the Bay view you had to literally stand in the window and peer round.Also our room 3807 was adjacent to the lifts and this was noisy during the night - if you can request a room as far from the lifts as possible."
We spent the first leg of our honeymoon at the Loews Regency San Francisco. Couldn't have had a better experience great service and large comfortable rooms with stunning views. Good location that gives you access to the entire city with a short walk. Restaurants aren't abundant in the area but not hard to get to. 
"Convenient hotel and quiet as the rooms start at level 40. Walk to Union Square, Chinatown and The Pier.Lack swimming pool and no tea making facility in room although kettle can be provided through house keeping. Very friendly staffs."
"The location is great but the views from this hotel just can't be beat!. I've got some favs in town but when I want to try something new the conceirge always has an excellent recommendation for me, and ther service is all around fantastic"
"Loews Regency is by far the best hotel in SF. Our room was fantastic with the best views I've ever had in a hotel. Just spectacular. The service is impeccable and the friendliness of the staff gave me that ""home away from home"" feeling. I can't recommend this hotel enough. A true gem."
"Plan and simply THE best hotel in SF. I've stayed at the Four Seasons & Ritz, both great, but there's just something at the Loews that always makes me feel like family, love my usual room, the amazing views (beautiful), and the amazing service! And the fantastic location, close to everything.. "
"Lovely room, friendly staff, and a great location - walking distance to the Ferry Building and Chinatown. There is a cable car stop one block away. Close to a number of restaurants, including the Tadich Grill.Outstanding concierge service."
The property is conveniently located in the financial district. The rooms are on the upper floors of the building offering panoramic views of the city. The restaurant was good with an excellent wine list. The room was spacious and well appointed.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Loews. The hotel had a friendly personal atmosphere. The staff were all very friendly and accommodating and the room was great-- our view of the city was amazing! I would highly recommend breakfast in the cafe it was delicious.
"I only stayed for a couple of night for a business meeting, however, I found the staff very polite and informed of the local area. The meeting facilities were great and the service and food of a very high standard."
"My husband and I stayed at Loews Regency San Francisco recently. Check in was smooth and the room was good. View was spectacular. However, we were a little surprised to find a Happy Anniversary card to a different couple. Made us wonder if that couple got moved to a better room. They were apparently celebrating their 3rd anniversary and we were celebrating our 10th. Kind of felt like we should have been moved to a better room! Aside from that, bathrooms could do with an upgrade. They seemed a little dated and the extraction fan was fuzzy with dust. Breakfast was delicious but we did not get the toast that should have come with it. I guess overall we were a little disappointed with the attention to detail. For the price we were paying, we had expected everything to be smooth like silk. And it was not. "
"We splurged and booked a bay view suite and the panoramic view certainly was spectacular ! Whilst the room was a good size and very comfortable, it was annoying not to have tea or coffee facilities in the room when considering the cost. You could get a complimentary coffee to go from the restaurant for a limited time each morning but we didn't find this convenient. The hotel was quiet and conveniently located for union Square, China Town and the seafront areas. We found the bar area small & it got filled quickly with business people attending conferences in the hotel, there is one restaurant and whilst the food was good, there is limited choice. All in all this hotel is fine for a couple of days whilst exploring the City, we were travelling from the Uk and stayed 5 nights, it was quite expensive to eat in the hotel on a daily basis but there are things locally which are more reasonable for breakfast / snacks. The front door staff were extremely helpful as was the concierge, they always had useful directions, reccomendations & bottles of water at the ready ! An enjoyable stay."
"If you want to be aggravated and have all of your allergies trigger, this will be my #1 spot to go. See Linda at the front desk for promises that will never be delivered and have a nice day :)she will go above and beyond to dissatisfied your needs and challenges."
"Wow, wow, wow! One of the most incredible views in San Francisco is to be had at this location and in such a room. With such a convenient location to the Ferry Building and other sites we loved to visit. Excellent!"
"This is one of those rare hotels I've stayed at which defines excellence. The service of the staff, the quality of the property, and the location of the hotel leave almost nothing more to be desired. The hotel is a solid choice while traveling for business or pleasure."
"I'm a hotel snob it takes a lot to impress me but the Hotel hit all the marks. If a view is important to you then there's no other hotel in San Francisco that you should even consider. I stayed in the Bay Bridge Junior Suite and I'll tell you the views were just breathtaking, there is a view from the shower and even the potty! The junior suite was very spacious and very well laid out the decor was very nice and the bed was extremely comfortable. Calvin the concierge was a absolute delight he made sure everything was perfect for my anniversary celebration. The entire staff was so kind and helpful it was such a amazing stay. If I had to suggest something it would be to update the mini fridge this hotel is way too nice for the cheap quality-I'm sure that's probably on their ""to do list"" as this was the former Mandarin Oriental Hotel. Bottom line..you won't find a better hotel stop searching and just book it !"
"We normally enjoy hotels like the Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton, but decided to stay here based on the great TripAdvisor ratings, the convenient location, the fact it wasn't on Nob Hill (walking to and from hotels on Nob Hill can be exhausting sometimes) and the more favorable pricing versus those other hotels. So glad we did! The hotel rooms are on floors 38-48, and we opted for a junior suite with a bay view. The vistas from our room were incredible! In addition to the bay, we could see the Golden Gate Bridge, the Transamerica Building, Alcatraz and Coit Tower. The room and bed were well appointed and very comfortable. While our room had a single sink, instead of a double sink as some other luxury hotels have, there was enough spaciousness in the bathroom for both my wife and I to use while grooming in the morning. However, what distinguishes a great hotel from a very good hotel is the personnel, and this hotel has some of the best, from the doorman Andy and Eduardo, to Alaine at the front desk, to Tom, the valet/bellman - all were professional, personable, friendly and welcoming. The maids were also a quantum level above the norm - very friendly, very competent,efficient, and engaging. Three days after arrival, Tom, who assisted us when we checked in, greeted my brother-in-law and me by name, having no other contact in the meantime. Amazing memory, and a true gift!While the hotel has a bar area, it lacks the vibe and energy of some other hotel bars. If you are interested in that, I'd recommend the bar in the Four Seasons, a little over 1/2 mile away.But that is hardly a reason for not endorsing this hotel, which I wholeheartedly do. When we return to San Francisco, this is where we plan to stay and look forward to doing so!"
Here on business for 3 days. Have corner room on 41st Floor with amazing view over the bay. Very nice room and bathroom. Good gym with plenty of exercise machines. Haven't used bar and restaurant but they look ok. Staff very helpful and pleasant. Good central location so haven't had to use taxis to get anywhere. Only grumble would be that breakfast not included in room rate (which is not cheap) so have been going to Starbucks for my morning coffee.
"The best view in SF - beautiful interior - top notch hotel. Sent photos of the view to friends and family and all wanted to come over! Excellent location in the financial district of San Francisco. A little pricey on parking your car overnight ($60 plus tax, uggh). Book well in advance to get a good rate otherwise its pretty expensive to stay."
"Spent my honeymoon, 47th floor gorgeous view, close to everything, and just a beautiful hotel and very accommodating staff. We will be back every anniversary, and maybe use the building possibly to renew vows later on..... Thanks Loews #"
"Our stay here was only one night but it made quite an impression. From the moment you arrive the staff is friendly and attentive. From the valet, to the front desk to the In Room Dining, they all make you feel like a VIP! The rooms are beautifully appointed and no detail is left out. The furnishings, the linens, the art on the walls--all thoughtfully chosen and tastefully done. The views from the room were spectacular and you are high enough to have a peaceful night's sleep--no noise from the streets."
"I have delayed this review because of an issue I had with the hotel. Having now stayed at all of the four properties booked on this vacation the problem I encountered can be put in perspective.My issue concerned breakfast. On the first two days my wife and I found both the service and food to be of the highest standard. The third day was frankly a disaster. The service was terrible. It was extremely slow, drinks were slopped, my wife was initially served the wrong tea and when the correct tea was delivered it didn't brew because the water wasn't hot enough. Her poached eggs were cold and my huevos rancheros was on the lukewarm side. Even when she was served a replacement it wasn't significantly better. One guest left after complaining he had waited too long to be served.The following day my wife's breakfast was fine but mine was again lukewarm.I raised it as an issue at checkout and following an exchange of emails the hotel have resolved my complaint to my satisfaction. I also feel they will have acted on my broader comment that I had seen one other guest who was unhappy signifying that at least on these two days there was a broader problem to be addressed.Having reached my final destination where the breakfast credit is half the amount allowed by this hotel I appreciate the extensive options Loews provide for the start of the day. Other than this I can say the hotel is in a good location. Many of the other hotels of this standard I passed have down and outs hanging around, some of whom were quite intimidating. I was relieved to be staying here.Other than the breakfast service on the third day all the staff were friendly and helpful.The rooms are clean, quiet and have comfortable beds."
Fantastic views of the city and the bay. Comfortable and quiet. Best hotel I have stayed in in my 30 years of traveling. And downtown. Excellent staff in every part of the hotel. Very close to the office where I had some meetings. Easy walking distance to awesome restaurants and not far from the Bart Stations (Montgomery and Embarcadero).
This hotel was just outstanding. The rooms were fantastic and the service was second to none. Room service food was delicious and served on a private table. The views from my room on the 44th floor were just beautiful.
"The hotel has rooms on the top floors of a tall office building. Not crowded. The views from the upper hallways and the rooms are fantastic. Even at night we had spectacular views of the bay and the Bay Bridge. The restaurant on the first floor is relatively small, and one morning we had to eat at small table that was not quite enough for two. But the service was great. The hotel is located in the financial district but close to shopping as well. Extremely quiet."
"I had a nice stay at Lowes. The bed was very comfortable, we had beautiful room service and the view from the sky deck was magnificent! That being said our room was a very awkward shape that made it difficult to even have enough room to even open a suitcase. Also the toilet was SO low, which would be difficult if you struggled with any sort of hip/knee problem. Overall it was really nice, but for this price point it didn't exceed my expectations. I would forsure stay here again if I was coming for work, but if I am in San Fran on holiday I would probably slurge to stay at The Ritz or Four Seasons."
"The Loews Regency was previously the Mandarin Oriental which I stayed a few times under the old ""label"". So this was the first visit under Loews. The hotel kept all the charm of the old Mandarin, and most of the old staff and it had a good feeling about it. The room I had was kept very clean and there was a breathtaking view of the Bay and Golden Gate Bridge. The gym was well equipped. Had a drink at the bar at the end of the day and the bartender - David was super friendly. Be careful about the valet parking cost as it is definitely not cheap. Great hotel overall."
"The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. Front desk staff was polite and diligent. We stayed for a business trip and the front desk staff did an exceptional job of printing documents for us prior to our meetings. They made our lives very easy. Additionally, the valet and bellman staff always addressed me by name and were prompt with bringing my car around every day."
"Enjoyed our stay at Loews. We were on the 38th floor in a ""Bridge to Bridge"" room. Unbelievable view of everything. Room was large, bed very comfortable. Location of hotel was good. We were able to walk most places. Union Square and the Ferry Building easy walks. Would highly recommend the hotel."
Clean. Quiet. Upscale. No fuss. Great service. Comfortable mattress. Slept almost as well as in my own bed. Loved the coffee in the morning. Perfect place when next day is busy with meetings or exploring SF.
"Staff were wonderful! The room was spotless, close to union square and the peir. Great views of the bay. Only thing that bothered me was that the toilet didnt flush well. Other then that they was grand!!"
I have reviewed The Loews Regancy many times; always wonderful. On this trip (our 4th this year) what came to mind was that The level of service at Loews Regency is as good if not better than the other 5 star San Francisco Hotels ( I have stayed at all of them) at the same price or less but Loews has an unparalleled views. Great value.
We celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary in a bridge to bridge suite. The service was exceptional. They went over and above to welcome us. The room was magical. Quite frankly it was difficult to go to sleep I was so entertained by the beautiful sights.
"Stayed here for business in the financial district. Hotel was very convenient, rooms are good size, bath products are high quality, and staff was very nice. Probably wouldn't recommend the atmosphere or decor for a romantic or family getaway, but was definitely a perfect choice for my purpose. Views were great as well!"
View from our Room was incredible and the Service from the front was amazing! If you need anything before your stay contact the concierge team and they will take care of you and give you good suggestions. The Bridge to Bridge rooms had just amazing views!
"Excellent stay, great service, incredible views in a great location. The hotel is in a quiet part of the city at least on weekends, with easy access to great restaurants for every meal. We will definitely be coming back. "
"We really enjoyed staying here. I splashed out on a Bridge to Bridge room on the 44th floor and you most certainly do get a view spanning the Bay Bridge, right round to the Golden Gate, taking in everything in-between. For example I could sit in the armchair with a view of the GG, Alcatraz, Pacific Heights, Coit Tower and the piers with a drink and a tour guide in hand - very inspiring.The decor is probably getting on a bit now, but so am I, and I wish I was as well-maintained to be frank. With the decor, that has to do with the keen service on offer here. Personally, any poor maintenance has more to do with the delicious Old Fashioned's on offer in the friendly and cosy cocktail bar downstairs.We only ate breakfast here as of course San Fran has many wonderful restaurants to offer for dinner, including an excellent Italian place around the corner if you don't fancy walking too far.I would heartily recommend this hotel for a comfortable stay with some amazing views and in a great spot for exploring this exciting city."
The staff was great and location was perfect. We rode the Bart train from the airport and it was easy and had to. Only walk 3 blocks to the hotelI will definitely stay there again.Restaurant was good but nothing special.We stayed on 39th floor and had an outstanding view 
One of my favorite places to stay in SFO. Extremely nice accomations and a great staff. The experience is always good. Location is convenient to restaurants and the local attractions. Rooms are spacious...but the bed is so comfortable!
"I think I have stayed at least 8 hotels in SF, and this one got the best view! However, its not cheap, so you want to have wonderful experience, you have to pay the price. The service is excellent, and in general, its really good."
"We had an excellent weekend stay at the Loews Regency. We frequent SF often, but this was our first time staying at this property and we were glad we made the choice to stay here. Valet was efficient and courteous. Check in was much faster than expected - we were given champagne while we checked in and upgraded to a deluxe king bay room. We had a weekend packed with plans so did not get to enjoy the on site restaurant and bar but will next time. We did attend the happy hour on the deck on the 40th(ish) floor before heading out to dinner and that was great! All staff we encountered was attentive and ready to help with any request. Next time we are in the area, we will be staying here!"
"Loews Regency SF was fabulous! Beautiful room, lots of marble and attention to detail. Bed and bedding were to die for. Great view. Friendly and professional staff. Doorman even remembered my name. I thought room was a bit pricy...but it was San Francisco! "
"We came down for a long birthday weekend. They accommodations were great - clean, comfortable and quiet. Within walking distance to several great restaurants! Staff were very attentive! We would stay here again."
"This hotel is perfect place by many attributes:1. Rooms with the amazing views, totally unbeatable2. The balcony in the 40th floor is with even more amazing views3. Service is top quality everywhere4. The rooms are so nice that you almost rather stay there than outside :-)5. The location "
"with larger hotel amenities. I was very pleased with my recent stay in the financial district of San Francisco. I was there for a gala at Yerba Buena Center. The location was convenient to the event, walking distance to the Embarcadero Centers, Union Square, and the foot of Market Street with ferry access. In addition, the CIty and Bay views from our guest room and other hotel locations were remarkably expansive and beautiful.I loved the boutique feel of the property. The staff was very friendly and accommodating/ The hotel restaurant had enough well prepared options to be satisfying and convenient during our 3 day stay.I can highly recommend the Loews Regency San Francisco without reservation. "
"Beautiful, spacious and luxury room and stunning views across the city... lovely, polite and friendly, helpful staff. Great location to everything to walk the city and see everything. Free Wi-fi too which is great to be able to play and work."
We booked months of time and paid premium prices but some things were a miss..first we stayed on the top floor and promise one thing and got another..disappoint. Room had a bit of odd smell but after waiting so long we decided to sleep and forget about it. We will not be back. But the hotel for most is perfect but not for us. The location is ok.Last time we stayed here it was the manadrian Oriential whole different experience.
"First time staying here (this was previously the Mandarin Oriental). Service was excellent, with two notable highlights: the doorman who took my bags as I left to return the rental car and the text message I got from the hotel asking me to text back if I ever needed anything during my stay. Killer views too-- on the 44th floor overlooking the Bay. Only thing missing was a standalone shower in the bathroom (used the tub instead)"
"The views from the room were amazing! Loved the floor plan, thoughtful detail on everything. The bathroom was lovely, with great shower and amenities. I loved the bed, comfy and lots of pillow selections."
WE had stayed at this facility when it was Mandarin Oriental. The service was fabulous and the view nothing short of spectacular. Staff was extremely friendly and professional. Basically every night the hotel's car took us to dinner and picked us up. They just volunteered this service. Highly recommended and very well located. 
"From the minute I walked into the lobby, I felt so well taken care of. The front desk staff was friendly and efficient. They upgraded me to a room with spectacular views of the Bay. I appreciated the bathroom amenities (built in makeup mirror, shower cap, cosmetic pads). I also appreciated the separate tub and shower.I would definitely stay here again."
Beautiful rooms with incredible views - so nice you may not want to leave your room!). Beds/linens are wonderful and there were pillow choices. Great staff - especially at door and at check-in. Will make this my preferred hotel when in SF.
After a long week working in EAST Bay My wife joined me for the weekend in San Fran - I thought I would surprise her for our 36th joint birthday by splurging on a 5 star hotel...Little did I know that this hotel aside from the view and sheets would hardly be considered a 4 star hotel.Negatives -Single ply toilet paper -viewing deck only open for 1 hour per day-out dated-no pool (not sure how they even classify)-no door man-overpriced parking $67 per night-the restaurant food tasted like a value village -terrible towels-clogged up bath tub-tv didn't turn towards bed Positives- good shower- view - really comfy sheets and pillows/bedsAll in all I would not recommend the hote for the price... look elsewhere unless you want the view? 
How LUCKY that we got the top floor (48th)! Loews is going in my top 10 hotels in the USA. The room was spacious and beautiful. The bathroom felt private and had enough space to hold our toiletries. Everything felt clean. The bed felt like a supportive cloud. I have ZERO complaints.I particularly enjoyed room service and would highly recommend it. The food is delicious and the service fantastic. They set breakfast up in front of the window and it was beautiful.
"This hotel will be the standard with a number of small adjustments if the effort is made to highlight the differences it provides including extraordinary views, particularly on the floors with skybridge room entrances, a great and seasoned staff (superb), a history of being exceptional, and hopefully, an intention to take the Mandarin Oriental ""bones"" and reinforce that legacy!"
"Great room, lovely bed with perfect pillows, large bathroom, very convenient location. Nailed it. Very nice for a quick business trip. It would work for a nice weekend, too. Walking distance to AT&T Park for baseball fans. "
"My husband and I stayed here for six nights last week, in a bridge to bridge view room. We had a fabulous stay, all the staff were very welcoming, especially the doorman who remembered our name each time. The concierge was very helpful and arranged tickets for the open top bus tour, and providing us with a much needed map. The lady who serviced our room in the morning and turndown service in the evening was extremely helpful. We ordered room service twice in the evening, the food was good, this was set up on a table right next to the window overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge, a very special experience.We arrived just in time on Saturday to experience wine down, this was a great start to our stay, with lovely glasses of Chardonnay on the open deck on the 40th floor, with great views across the city to the bay. Our room was a bridge to bridge room on the 44th floor, fantastic views, we loved admiring the beautiful views. The bed was so comfortable, we wished we could take it home with us, we slept so well.We loved the location of the hotel in the Financial District, the cable car was very close by. Embarcadero which is a five minute walk is a great area too. The transport in the city is excellent. We purchased a mobile Muni pass, which we used many times and would recommend. The only gripe we would have is our room had a connecting door, luckily our neighbours were very thoughtful and we only heard a noise once in our six day stay. When we return to San Francisco we would definitely stay in this hotel and we would wholeheartedly recommend it. Thank you to all the staff."
"Was very happy with this hotel. Design is nothing special but hotel is very clean. I was upgraded to a big room with 180 views from huge windows. Service is good, concierge was very good and free wifi worked well. Breakfast is expensive. Location was excellent walking distance from all the top attractions. "
The Loews Hotel combines gracious service with a beautiful facility in a great location. It is one of the best business hotels I have stayed in. The whole team is very accommodating and aims to please.
"Underwhelming. Low end staff was outstanding. Views were terrific. Not at all as modern as marketed. Not family friendly at all. Some staff members were willing to sell rather than meet our needs. Other than views, it underperformed in every area compared to Ritz, Four Seasons, and even some not so high end places in the city. "
"A very friendly, helpful and great hotel!The staff were very warm and welcoming upon arrival and we were allowed to check in a little early plus given an upgrade which was perfect after a long travel!Our room was very clean and spacious with stunning views over the city. Unfortunately there were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room, although each day from 5:30 - 8:30 am tea and coffee was available downstairs. The bed was one of the comfiest I've ever slept in! The weekend wine down (free drinks) was great to relax after a full days sightseeing and the views there were spectacular! I'd love to stay here again next time I visit SF!"
Spent 3 nights here with my husband. We were upgraded to a suite on the 46th floor on arrival which was a lovely perk! The room was beautiful with spectacular views of the city. The bed was genuinely the most comfortable I've ever slept in! There are no words for the mattress. I slept like a baby every night - and believe me I don't normally sleep!! We didn't eat in the hotel as it was quite pricey and there are loads of great eateries nearby. Service was attentive. I used the gym every day which is great and very quiet. We were invited to have drinks on Friday and Saturday night on the 40th floor in a space normally used for functions. Wonderful views of the city and lovely champagne! The hotel is centrally placed and walkable to most of the sites.
"When this property was Mandarin Oriental, we visited a couple of times a year for anniversary and birthday celebrations - special occasions that called for the extraordinary. We loved the hotel because of ethereal sensation of being in the clouds, the utter luxury of the experience and the fantastic service. I am please to report that the change of ownership to Loews has not diminished the experience whatsoever.Our room was 4014 and faced the panoramic view of the bay bridge. We even had the view of the bay from the deep sunken tub over a glass of champagne. The room was spacious and so comfortable. The bedding was ultra-fine and the down comforter promoted deep sleep. The staff was exceptional throughout our stay from check-in to check-out. The only hiccup was that our car took a little longer to pull up one time than expected. The Hotel breakfast in the lobby level was also wonderful. Fast and attentive service throughout and the food was delicious.We look forward to our next stay and this very special property that has become our very favorite in all of San Francisco."
Was offered a nice glass of champagne upon check-in. Beautiful room with a great view of the bay. Friendly and professional staff. Restaurant is good but a bit pricey. Walking distance to Ferry building. Price for the room is not too bad given the real estate and level of hotel. Highly recommended.
"For all around comfort, location, and services, you can't beat this hotel. I had a lovely love seat adjacent to the bed area where I curled up with my granddaughter for tea. I was only a few blocks away from SFMOMA and lots of great restaurants. The concierges were unfailingly helpful in making recommendations and answering questions. They were always polite and upbeat. I will return for more of the above."
"Extraordinary accommodations and customer service. The staff is impeccable from the valet helping me with luggage, the front desk staff at check-in as well as housekeeping and their attention to detail."
"My Wife and I were celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary and, after seeing so many excellent reviews for the Loews Regency, decided to stay here. We booked a Bridge to Bridge view room and the view was amazing! The views alone would be enough to make me want to return for another stay but the wonderful staff take this hotel to another level. Upon our arrival the staff had placed a bottle of champagne and some chocolate covered strawberries in our room and a nice hand written note. It was the perfect start to our vacation and a very nice and thoughtful surprise. If this was all the hotel did to make us feel special it would have been enough but they were just getting started. Every person we saw remembered our names and greeted us warmly every time many of them even wishing us a happy anniversary. They also acted quickly when I had an accident in my room cutting myself pretty badly when I broke a wine glass. They sent someone up quickly with bandages and first aid equipment. After going to the hospital and getting patched up everyone on staff that I saw would ask if I was doing better. It was just one of the many ways this staff worked to make sure our visit was enjoyable. If you are visiting and looking for somewhere to eat just ask the concierge team and they will make some amazing suggestions. They also got us some reservations even on a busy Saturday night. The doormen are so welcoming and helpful. Whether it was giving directions, hailing a cab, or arranging the house car they always provided excellent and friendly service. They truly make you feel special while staying at the hotel. My Wife and I had an excellent celebration of 15 years together and this hotel and its staff played a huge role in our enjoyment. We can’t wait to return there and would recommend the hotel to anyone looking to stay in San Francisco."
"Friendly staff, always going the extra mile. Pricey, but worth it Convenient Financial District location with great views of the golden gate bridge, Bay Bridge light show, and highrise buildings. I was there for my daughter's wedding, so hard to upset me on that weekend."
"The rooms were very comfortable, excellent views of the Bay and it was easy walk to interesting sites and shopping. We like the comfort and views the best. The only negative was the breakfast package really didn't save us any costs, so that made us feel like it was a fake deal."
The staff went out of their way to make our trip great. The staff met all of our needs. Location is great- near the ferry building. Would defiantly stay there again. This was my first stay at a loews and will try and do it more often. 
"This hotel exemplifies what a hotel should be like. From the first moment through its doors to the moment you check out, they care about you, pay attention, and make things super easy and convenient. Someone understands the travel and hospitality industry!"
This hotel is nicely located with large view rooms (with windows that open!) and a wonderful customer service-oriented staff. They were very accommodating and professional. The ferry building and Union Square are both within walking distance as well as the Museum of Modern Art.
"So often the 5 star rated hotels fail to deliver as they set expectations so high that they inevitably fail to deliver. But this was not true of this hotel. From arrival, throughout the stay and upon departure, the staff was outstanding. Special thanks to the superb concierge staff, Dean and Calvin, for thinking of every detail. Great room with excellent views on the 40th floor., with unique layout. Excellent location, steps away from great restaurants. Extremely comfortable bed with quality linens, duvet and pillows. Efficient room service."
"Good location, very unpleasant entrance and lobby, tired furniture and this old smell, average service , gym is ok but not great , service is fine but not great. Unbelievable views. Looking at value for money I would not recommend this hotel."
"Pros: Amazing views, large rooms, service was top notch, comfortable beds, and large soap bottles, great locationCons: Doors have a tendency to slam shut, the gym was small but able to get on a treadmill, business center had a weird smell."
"Great staff, very comfortable hotel, made it very easy to work (and have a drink afterwards!). The staff were particularly friendly and helpful with any ask. The location is also excellent during the week - a bit dead at the weekends, but very convenient."
"A beautiful hotel with a wonderful staff right from the greeting by the valet at the entrance, bell hop, front desk and on the floor. The rooms are fantastic with beautiful views. When we used room service, the service was excellent."
"I hosted a one-day conference with the Loews Regency and could not have been happier with the service! They made sure all our customers were upgraded and comfortable with their stay. If there were any concerns with check-in or check-out they called me and asked before turning our customer away or charging our master account. The meeting space was convenient, banquets staff was accommodating and on top of everything and the meetings team was a pleasure to work with. The rooms themselves; spectacular! Highly recommend this hotel!"
"Great views of SF. Literally we were so high we could not see the ants on the street. Just what you want to have looking at the bay and bridges. Lovely. I did have a hard time picturing this hotel as a Mandarin, however. Not really the quality I expect from a Mandarin and the spa was an afterthought. A little closet disguised as a reception - and then you were led into another closer. Weird. Not sure if it is on my 'return' list but like I said, the views were spectacular."
Our room had amazing views of both the Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge. You could really see forever.The Bell staff were impeccable. They remembered our names every time we came and went from the hotel. Our bed was luxurious and the pillows were just the right softness. Had excellent sleep every night. I loved the location as we were able to walk to everything. Highly recommend this hotel. It has become my favorite San Francisco Hotel!
Highly recommend... incredible staff that is super friendly and eager to help. Not to mention the luxury bridge to bridge rooms are absolutely stunning. Best experience in san francisco so far. Also for a hotel the dining experience felt like I was at a 5 star restaurant. All in all it is a must go. 
"I loved my birthday getaway! The hotel is great and the staff is superb. Everyone was so nice and helpful. Check in was a breeze and they upgraded us to the 46th floor with great bay views. They even sent a birthday card and chocolate covered strawberries to our room as a birthday gift; which i thought was amazing. Made the experience even more personal. The location of the hotel is also central to everything, which made exploring San Francisco easier."
"One of the things that sets this hotel apart is the service. Many of the employees are the same as when the hotel used to be the Mandarin. The rooms are on the upper floors of the building, many commanding spectacular views. The rooms are clean but are a bit dated. My one complaint is that there is not much space in the bathrooms for storing essentials despite the fact that the rooms are on the larger side. All in all this is still a very good place to stay. "
"We were going to visit San Francisco to visit my son. We wanted to stay in a hotel on flat street , no hills for me. I saw the Lowe's Regency and decided to stay there.When we walked in my wife and I thought there was something familiar about the hotel. We went up to our room on the 40th floor. It was a comfortable king room with a livingroom couch that was very very comfortable. The king bed was comfortable and the bathroom was fine. The A/C could not circulate the air evenly in the room for my wife and I who like cold rooms.There is a desk in the room which has electrical outlets on top so charging phones and tablets was easy with no getting on your knees to locate an outlet. The TV was hinged on the wall so that you could see it in the sitting area or swing it for watching in bed.Our room had a fantastic view from the bay bridge to Alcatraz with a glimpse of the Golden Gate Bridge.When I met my son in the lobby he said that we had stayed here some years before when it was the Mandarin Oriental. The hotel is better than that the MO.The food in the lobby restaurant is excellent. The food from Room Service was also excellent. There is a spa where I had a standard spa massage.I must mention that there is free Wifi and the speed was terrific reaching 19.7 Megabytes per second, which is faster than I get in my home or at any other hotel I have stayed in before.The blackout drapes keep the light out with no light between the drape panels.If you want snack food there is a 7-11 across the street and a good liquor store next door. The Starbucks is a short walk away.There s a cab stand in front so getting around is easy."
"Great location in the Financial District, Beautiful and comfortable guest rooms, warm and welcoming staff available to assist in my every possible need and great food...Loved every aspect of my stay. I was treated like royalty!"
"FANTASTIC! Have stayed at the very best all around SF (i.e.: Fairmount, Mark Hopkins, Westin U.S., St. Regis, and more) and in all other major distinction cities around the country (i.e.: Vegas, NY, LA, Chicago, D.C., Boston, etc.) and without a 2nd thought I would put this hotel among the top 5 in the county for A+ caliber service, detail and exceptionally maintained accommodations, and all at very reasonable best-in-class price. 44th floor (room #4404) has the best view of any room we have got from any hotel we have stayed in S.F. ever. Housekeeping services we so quiet we never heard them even though we slept in late both days. Room was most well-designed and thought out in comparison to the very best we have seen around the country. Building feels brand new (vs. in just about all other hotels in S.F. which smell and feel ""old""). It all makes sense as this hotel was ""Mandarin Oriental"" all the way into 2016...which is absolutely the best in class..."
My partner and I stayed one night after we got engaged. We were pleasantly surprised with an upgraded room. Being at the top of one of the tallest buildings in downtown San Francisco the views from the room was beautiful. The room itself was quite large. The furniture and design was nice but seemed a bit dated to me. In terms of food and drink the restaurant and bar were ok. They served the standard breakfast and decent cocktails but I found them to be a bit overpriced. We never eat dinner at the hotel so can’t comment on that. I would recommend that you get out of the Hotel and try one of the many great restaurants nearby the concierge was excellent and recommended some great places to eat. Overall we had a great experience and would like to thank Loris the General Manager and his team for an excellent start to our engagement.
"My husband and I have traveled extensively worldwide and this is one of the top places we have ever stayed. Let's start with the staff. Everyone had a great attitude! The concierge, doormen, front desk, managers, room service, cleaning staff......it was amazing! No one had a bad attitude and everyone was eager to assist with anything we needed hep with. The hotel itself is fabulous. We had floor to ceiling glass and tremendous views from the 47th floor. The room was lovely, immaculate and no detail was missed. We have stayed in many SFO hotels and this is by far the best. Highly, highly recommend! Additionally there is not a bad restaurant in the Financial District close to the hotel. We loved every minute of our trip."
"Popped in for a one night rendezvous. First impression: short, awkward, valet loading zone. The valet attendent, and service overall, was courteous and efficient. As mentioned in other reviews, there really isn't a lobby to lounge. This former Mandarin Oriental property seems to be partially remodeled as far as I can see from online photos. Our room faced south, and the view was just okay. The bedroom part of our room seemed to be have been remodelded, but I think the bathroom was a remanent of MO. We visited the restaurant bar, and it was lovely. Excellent drinks and snacks and a mature crowd. We later enjoyed room service which was delicious. Neighborhood-wise, this is the financial district that keeps business hours, so don't expect a lively scene. Overall, a very good stay."
"You cannot go wrong. Staff new our names at every turn, great room with a bay view- I requested the bay view room after checking into a city view room and the front desk switched me withing 5 mins! Concierge was very knowledgeable and helpful!"
"A truly memorable night. We wanted to get in earlier and stay longer but were competing with literally thousands of Oracle conventioneers. We got a 43rd floor room overlooking the whole bay so the Golden Gate bridge, Coit Tower, Alcatraz, Transamerica tower, and most of the classic views were in plain sight. It was during a record setting heat wave (mid 90s) and our air conditioning didn't work at first. We went to dinner and it was good when we returned.We first stayed at a Loews for a wedding January 2016, and it was superb, the Loews Madison in DC. The capitol city was still reeling from a huge snowstorm a week earlier but the hotel didn't disappoint. If these two are any indication, this is a top notch brand."
This hotel is top notch from check-in to check-out. Staff is welcoming and helpful in recommendations nearby or across town. Location is also walkable to the Ferry Building. Clean rooms. We stayed in the City View Deluxe and had an amazing view of the Bay Bridge. Would highly recommend this hotel. 
"What you would expect from a Loews property - nicely appointed, formal service, price tag to match. I prefer boutique hotels in quieter residential areas, but this is a good pic for business in SF, if you need to be downtown. Views are spectacular on the high floors. Rooms are large. Crowd is on the mature side and mostly business travelers or well-heeled foreign tourists."
"The a acccommendations met every high mark. It was a truly a pleasure to stay in such a wonderful place. Views were spectacular, cocktail bar & lounge top notch. I wish I could have stayed longer and used the spa facility."
"This was the smoothest check-in I've ever had! We arrived early Saturday morning, so I wasn't expecting our room to be ready yet. Not only was there no line to check in, but I was told that our room was ready immediately & that they would give us a complimentary upgrade. They sent chocolate-covered strawberries because it was my husband's birthday. The room had fabulous views & a very comfy bed. Every time we entered the lobby, staff greeted us warmly, offering umbrellas & the use of a town car (1 mile radius). Even the apples in the lobby were great--crisp & sweet! There was no line to check out, either; I was helped immediately. I'm so glad I chose Loews!"
"Spent the weekend with my husband after a business trip south of the city. Once you get through all of the Friday night traffic, this hotel in the less touristy financial district is like an oasis. Honestly, one of the quietest hotels I have ever stayed in and I travel frequently. From our room we had views of the bay bridge and the golden gate as it was a corner room - bright and sunny. Beautiful!! The rooms were spotless, beds incredibly comfortable and service to die for. Rooms service was delivered in 10 mins. The bartenders and front desk staff were so helpful and accommodating - even getting us prized seats at the chef's table at Tyler Florence's incredibly popular restaurant a few blocks away. Spa was very good for a quick afternoon massage. Bar was again, pretty quiet, just stopped on our way out for a quick drink before walking to dinner but didn't really seem like a hot spot. Did not eat at the hotel but restaurant was pretty quiet as well. Fantastic service start to end. Will come back again next time in the city!"
"The hotel is in the center of the financial district accessible by BART train from SFO International Terminal station exit Montgomery Station and it's 2 blocks away down Sansome Street. The hotel is close by to the famous Chinatown as well as Union Square all accessible by foot so wear comfortable shoes. Taxis and cars can be used but it might be more hassle since there's a lot of one ways, no turns, and let's forget about trying to find parking or paying the substantially high priced parking lots. I recommend not getting a vehicle during your visit. Walking during most of the year is doable as SF temperature is usually moderate on the cooler end but never freezing. SF is also the home of many carsharing so that is an alternative if walking is undersirable. Finding food is never an issue as San Francisco is home to many restaurants and cuisines, the hotel staff is very helpful in making recommendations in addition to the hotel restaurant. The rooms are spacious, clean, and there's plenty of sunlight. This is a good hotel many for business travelers but also good for leisure travelers who want to be closer to Chinatown or the Embarcadero. Close enough to Union Square without being too congested or having it too noisy during the night."
"Stayed in one of the bridge to bridge rooms. Absolutely spectacular views , from the Golden Gate to Alcatraz to the Bay Bridge. Top notch service starring with check in. Convenient location within walking distance of the ferry port and Union Square. "
"Last year I logged over 20 trips and am constantly popping in & out of great hotels. I also happen to work at a hotel, which would make me a tough critic. Stayed here at the tail end of a work trip in SF...and it was by far the highlight of the week. Service here is incredibly intuitive and not overwhelmingly oppressive as it often is in many luxury hotels. The staff are genuine and seem to have a high emotional intelligence to understand their guest's needs. The views are amazing!!! If having a good gym is important for you, the one here is fantastic. Overall a great experience. I'll be recommending the Loews Regency in SF!"
We had a last minute trip to SF and thought the Loews Regency looked very nice on the website and we were not disappointed! Beautiful hotel with great views and excellent service! We will definitely be back!
"We stayed 4 nights at the Loews Regency in the business district of San Francisco. We were greeted by the doorman and the front desk very warmly when we arrived. We were then taken to our room on the 47th floor with the most beautiful views on the bay from the Golden Gate Bridge, Sausilito, Alcatraz, to the lit up Bay Bridge. Unbelievable. The service at all levels is over the top and always with smiles. The best in SF and we have stayed all over SF the last 25 years We will be back"
"Clean, convenient, great location in the heart of San Fransisco, and great service.The room was very nice overlooking the city and both the Golden Gate Bridge and the Bay Bridge. Really nice atmosphere and relaxing. "
"From start to finish, Loews was a wonderful location to stay while in town for both work and vacation. The Bell staff was always attentive and helpful. Check-in was efficient and professional, and friendly! Housekeepers do great work and the room was spotless.Rooms are very good-sized for a city hotel, and owing to their high location are pretty quiet and insulated from the city noise. Views are second to none, and can't be beat by any other hotel in the city.Fitness facilities clean and inviting. I will review the in-house restaurant in another review, but it did exceed expectations as well.Loews seems to have guest services down. They handled all the little details, and our few minor requests/needs were no problem for them."
"Over the years I’ve found it difficult to find a handful of downtown San Francisco hotels that I like, and are also a good value. Obviously, it’s an expensive city to stay in. I’ve stayed at other Loews’ hotels in other cities, but never at their San Francisco property so I thought I would try it. It was very nice. I will definitely be adding it to the “return” list. Quiet, with beautiful views of the city, and a perfect location for downtown walking access. Will return."
We had just one night at the start of our holiday but what a stay. The best views of any hotel. Very friendly and helpful staff. Concierge gave us some great tips about what to see. The location is great everything is close by
"We stayed here for 3 nights and the best part was the friendliness and helpfulness of the front desk staff and doormen. They couldn't have been nicer or more sincere about wanting to help in any way they could.Our room on the 39th floor was lovely. The bathroom was large and the marble in the bathroom was beautiful. The only negatives were that it is a bathtub shower set up and the shower was a hand held design. I prefer an actual shower room with a proper shower head. I was also surprised that I could hear the people in the room next door opening and closing the dresser drawers very early one morning.The other surprise was that the hotel does not have a lobby with comfortable seating if you want to leave your room. Instead, the restaurant takes up most of the space."
"Lovely hotel! Dining room needs more servers and opening at 7:00am is too late. My only complaints.Rooms and views were beautiful.Reception area, bell men, car service, maid service were all kind and personable."
"First of all the staff is amazing from the moment you pull up. Everyone was very friendly and courteous. The rooms are clean, it's quiet and the views again are amazing. This will definitely be my place to stay when ever in San Francisco "
"We were visiting SF over the New Year's Eve and booked a Bridge to Bridge Room on the 42th - boy what a view! Also very lucky with NYE fireworks as we could see the fireworks barge and bay bridge for a spectacular show between the gap in the buildings. We had breakfast in restaurant once - a little expensive but a nice setting; found a great inexpensive cafe Dillers just round the corner. Location was perfect - we walked to all the major sites from here: Chinatown, Ferry Building, Coit Tower, Fishermans Wharf, SF MoMA, Union Square, Lombard St - only took one bus ( stop close to hotel) to Golden Gate Bridge walked across all the way to Sausalito back on the Ferry and short walk back to hotel. In summary excellent location, high quality hotel, with very friendly staff - not cheap but worth it."
"I cannot write enough about this hotel . I felt like a movie star when I stayed here . I have never ever had so much time , care, and hospitality shown to me for being a basic guest ! Upon checking in the manger greeted us and personally escorted me and my boyfriend to our room giving us a history of the hotel as well . When does that happen ???!!!! Ahhh never ! The actual room was epic !!! Gorgeous views of all of San Fran water! Both bridges !! The bridge to bridge view is sooo worth it !!the room was crazy clean ! Luxurious !!! And did I say the views are epic !!! Then the manager Julia ( who is the best!) sent up champagne and chocolate covered fruit because she heard it was my boyfriends birthday !!! Again who does that !!! Every staff member was so helpful ! The beds were sooo comfy ! That night after coming home from dinner , chocolate covered strawberries were waiting for us in our room !!!Just to say thanks for staying with them !!! Again when does that happen !!There is a reason this hotel is number 2 in a huge city !!! It's the best ! In my opinion it should be #1!! You need to stay here !!! If you want an experience that has a home away from home feeling with nothing but CLASS attached !! stay here !!! Amazing hotel !!! Oh and p.s upon checking out our bill was on point no weird or hidden charges !! Thank you Loews staff for an epic experience !! I had to book this hotel the following week for my boyfriends parents who were going to San Fran just because it was so amazing ! I called the hotel and they set up a great room for them !! I feel like I made friends with this hotel for just being a normal guest !! Thank you !!! "
The hotel catered very well for our family of four - from extremely helpful check in staff through to doormen and the use of the hotel car service. Rooms were spacious and well appointed with excellent views of the city.
"First time on San Francisco. Since I was only there for a few days I wanted a killer view, especially of the Golden Gate Bridge. There are not many hotel locations for this. We were room 4206 ""bridge to bridge"" view. The view was truly spectacular. And even came with binoculars to take in all the sites. The Golden Gate Bridge was further away than the Bay Bridge and the GG wasn't lit at night. But in the morning once the fog rolls off, there she was in all her burnt orange glory, simply beautiful and iconic. As for the room, the bed was sublime and bathroom was well appointed. Also the carpet in the room is very plush. I don't normally use the hotel toiletries but I tried these and found them of high quality, especially the hair care products. There isn't much hotel lobby which was surprising, but it's a small hotel and you feel very private and secluded, which is nice. Nice touches included the custom water bottles with pictures of the view and the slippers. Coffee is available for free in the restaurant area and was the best I've ever had!! So smooth and rich. Communication by hotel staff wasn't the best. We didn't know about the free coffee until checking out and only because I found it. Also I've read about the hotel car but staff never mentioned it to us when we were taking Ubers and taxis to dinner. I've also read about the hotel acknowledging special milestones but I never heard anything from them about my birthday. So more communication would be nice. But overall it was a fabulous hotel and view which I highly recommend, especially to celebrate a special occasion. These pictures are from our room! "
The staff were amazing and friendly. We were on the 47th floor and the views were breathtaking. The room and hotel was very clean and comfortable. I would highly recommend staying here. Very close to Fisherman's Wharf and Union Square.
"I did not expect this hotel to be so nice! I stayed with my boyfriend for 5 nights and we enjoyed our stay! We were on the top floor and it was a beautiful view. It is about a mile walk from the pier and it was a nice walk. The only thing is that this area is the financial district so places close early and the streets are pretty empty. Room service here was pricey for the quality of food received. Overall, I would stay here again. Oh and definitely check out the complimentary champagne toast on the rooftop at sunset on Saturday night (awesome panoramic city picture)!"
"We came to this hotel without pre booking during our honeymoon road trip. The staff were friendly and very helpful.The hotel is located near public transportation and a walking distance from union square and various other interesting locations.The rooms are very clean and tidy, and the top floor rooms have an amazing view of the city and the bay!!It was raining in SF and we didn't have an umbrella and were surprised to find out they were handing out umbrellas in the concierge services.In addition to all of that they even gave us a complementary honeymoon surprise box with various treats such as walnuts and chocolates.very recommended!"
"This hotel was once a great stay. That is, when it was the Mandarin Oriental. I have stayed here many times, and now under the Loews Flag it's gets worse every visit. The rooms are badly in need of a refresh, and the hotel lacks things like a Sauna, Steam room etc. Other than the cleaning staff, the level of service is generally surly. On my most recent stay, they were having massive problems with their electronic locks for all of the guest rooms. We called down to get a bucket of ice, and were told that there would be a $15 charge per bucket. This due to high demand. This is a first for me. My last stay at this once excellent hotel. Dean Dordevic - Portland OR"
Amazing staff and great property. The views were incredible and we cannot say enough good things about the staff. They go out of their way at every turn to make guests feel welcome and to accomodate every need. We were traveling with three kids. They upgraded our room and helped plan five days of kid activites around the city. A truly unique hotel.
Thank you to the staff at the Loews Regency Hotel for a wonderful stay.The Loews is in a brilliant location with one of the best views (I was on the 41st floor) of this wonderfully romantic city.I ordered room service twice and both were delivered on time and were completely delicious.I also need to thank the room service crew for organising breakfast slightly early for my pre 6am start.Already looking forward to my next stay at this fabulous hotel.
Stayed for 9 nights on business and I travel quite frequently to SF. This is by far the best service and views! Clean rooms and very nice staff. Turn down was a little disappointing however I would call housekeeping for extras. 
"I always book the Bridge to Bridge suite in this hotel. The floor to ceiling windows provide unbelievable views of the bay, Alcatraz, Coit Tower, and both bridges. The services is consistently excellent, the gym and spa above average, even for a luxury hotel. The suite is spacious and comfortable. Go to sleep with your blinds open and wake up to breathtaking views of the city in the morning."
"A fairly small hotel but with very high floors. It was very comfortable. The bed was great, and I meant to try to find out what it was so I could look at buying one. It really was that good. Had a few hiccups at breakfast with my order, but you know what, there was no drama and rectified immediately. We all make mistakes but its the way that it is resolved that matters so I am not going mark them down for it at all. The one thing I would say is that I was told by a colleague that there was a lounge on one of the high floors. It would be nice if the check in staff told you this."
"We booked this hotel on a recommendation from a family member. It was conveniently located downtown, close to the Bart access points, close to the piers and China town. Staff was incredible and the concierge service was over the top! Offered us maps, water and wished us a good time any time we left. I will rebook on a next visit to the area."
"I had an indescribably excellent stay at this hotel. A room right next to the presidential suite and a magically perfect view. The staff is very warm and professional. Soo hospitable. Great In-Room-Dining, but it's also worth it to dine outside because the location in the center of the financial district is really a good starting point. First class hotel, its 5 stars well deserved."
"Great place for business travel or vacation. Would recommend to other colleaguesand family. Great view of the Bay as well as the city!Food was a little expensive, but good. Staff was very helpful.Walking distance to about everywhere."
"The Pros:1. The staff: everyone was extremely professional and welcoming from the moment I stepped foot onto the property. There were staff to open the doors, greet you and so forth. The front desk was attentive and helpful. The bartender was knowledgeable about the hour, offered suggestions for restaurants after hours and gave great advice for food selection at the Loews. Every staff member that I ran into seemed to be determined to make the guests' stay top notch. 2. The room: I had a king room on the top floor (48th). The room was a nice size, the bed was quite comfortable and the bathroom was actually quite large. There was ice every evening and the cleaning staff did a superb job. 3. The view: I've never seen anything like it. I had a direct view of the Transamerica Building and the bay. I could see the Golden Gate, Alcatraz and so forth. There were even binoculars to get a better view of everything outside your window! It was the best view I've had in any hotel. Ever. It was incredible. The cons:1. Heights: not a con for everyone, but it was an interesting time being fearful of heights. There was a bridge leading from the elevators to my room. The bridge was surrounded by glass on both sides and it had spectacular views. That being said, I basically ran down the hallway to get to my room as it gave me vertigo. Not an issue for everyone, but just know that the rooms are quite high up! 2. I had to leave. So sad. So incredibly sad."
"I bought a voucher from Gilt.com which included a 100 min Swedish massage with a 30 min express facial. I was a little put off with the fact that I had to pay extra cash just to use their amenities (not sure if this applies to guest staying at Loews), I cringed at the fact that I had to go home without a shower (the charge was ridiculous for a small amt of time). Their lounge was at least free to use but there wasn't really much to it.The place is very nice and has a relaxing ambiance to it. I filled out paper work and was escorted to their lounge where my masseuse greeted me. The room was nice clean and relaxing. Can't remember my masseuses name but he did a good job with everything. After my massage I met my esthetician, Christina, who was awesome. I fell in love with her in the short 30 mins that I had with her. She tried her best to meet my skin concerns/needs and gave me great advice on skin care. She even did some extractions which weren't included in my package! I'm definitely going back to see her again!I rated this Spa 4/5 because of the extra charge to use their amenities and that there is a lack of communication. I had to tell my masseuse at the end that I had a facial next and I like having a more fluid transition. Overall great place!"
"Recently stayed here for 3 nights. Beautiful hotel well positioned for exploring this city. The service was impeccable from the moment we arrived. I especially want to thank Michael from the bell desk who was just so friendly and helpful and always smiling. We stayed in a bridge to bridge view room which was fantastic, large room with great views. Highly recommended. "
"I've reviewed The Loews Regency before but it bears repeating that this is an excellent Hotel. The staff here could give seminars on how a luxury hotel should be run. The experience is always warm and inviting, service incredible and coupled with the views, simply fabulous. This will be our San Francisco destination hotel for years to come."
"Was booked for 2 queen bed city view, was upgraded for free to bridge to bridge view room, spectacular views. Room was immaculate, staff was extremely nice and helpful. Definately worth the price. Friday and Saturday there was a reception for guests on a high floor balcony. Overall an excellent quality hotel, with a superbly trained staff."
This is a fine hotel and you get what you pay for. The rooms are fairly high up and there is some wait time with the elevator. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. The views are absolutely incredible. The restaurant in the lobby is good. I will look to stay here again when in SF.
"My first stay at your hotel was half a year ago and I was gladly surprised, that upon my return this month, I was greeted by my name when I arrived after a very long journey from Barcelona by the same bellman who remembered me form my previous stay. I absolutely enjoyed the accommodation and felt like I was in my own residence. I did dream I lived here for a week! The new carpet in the guestroom is beautiful and cozy. I also felt safe and appreciated the privacy and beauty of the views on the 42nd floor. They are unforgettable. Wonderful service from the Housekeepers and from In Room Dining teams. The Concierge and Bellmen/Doormen were always available and knew when I was gone or came back from my meetings.One evening when they knew my meeting was a long commute away (because they had provided me detailed and accurate directions) they welcomed me back and said ""Ms. Climent we were worried about you and are happy that you are back. Hope your meetings went well. Have a restful night and see you again tomorrow"". Such genuine and caring service is often hard to find even in luxury hotel brands. Congratulations to all of you and to your leadership. I can't wait to be back!"
"And we've stayed at some very nice hotels (Ritz, Plaza, etc.). The staff were incredibly accommodating and friendly. Sooo hospitable. The food was excellent, not just a give-up. Truly excellent. Our room was clean, beautiful, and had everything we needed... even binoculars for the beautiful view. View OUTSTANDING. The best in San Francisco."
"I travel a lot for work and am in SFO a lot. I love testing out new hotels and have my tried and true faves. However this is definitely at the top of my list. The staff is top notch from the moment your taxi pulls to the curb. Also the staff are not snobby or uppity. Definitely refreshing! The hotel rooms are beautiful and if you order room service the staff uses the rooms' doorbell instead of knocking. It's the little touches like that that makes you feel like you're at home. They take the five star hotel standards up a notch and dare I say their gym access is free! Gasp. Something a few other 4-4.5 star hotels in the area should take note. Prime locale if you're here for work since it's in the Financial District. But even if you're not, you're still a 10 min walk to Union Square and not far from the water. All in all a fab location. Loved my stay here and look forward to coming back on all my future trips. "
"We stay in San Francisco about once a year and found that Loew's was just about perfect. If we needed to be in the financial district this would be a first choice. The staff was one of the most genuinely friendly we've ever encountered in our many travels. The three small downsides: on weekends, there's not much nearby in the way of sights and cafes, but we didn't really need that; we wanted a centrally located place and took cabs everywhere. Like many great hotels, they have down comforters, and we have a very hard time sleeping with the extreme warmth. We should have checked to see if there was a blanket or two instead; that was our bad, not theirs. And, there's no pool, which is my primary workout need. I could not stay here for a week, for instance. Would definitely recommend and go back."
"My teen daughter and I took a mother daughter trip to SF and picked this hotel for location (I didn't want to stay in the busiest sections like Union Square but wanted to be within walking distance) and price. We stayed 4 nights. The price was great compared to other hotels (less than $400/night including all taxes and fees - SF taxes are very high for all hotels so beware when booking). The lobby is very nice and not overly large, which I liked. Complimentary fresh fruit was put out every day. Our check in was very fast and we were informed that there is a complimentary wine and champagne hour every Fri. and Sat. outside on a viewing deck on the 40th floor. This was such an awesome way to start our trip. It was sunset and twilight and the views were amazing (see forst photo). I booked the hotel on the Loew's website and requested an upper floor under ""requests"" in the online booking, And we got a room on the 42nd floor (3 floors from the top). The view was great (see second picture). If I had to do all over, I would also request a view on the TransAmerica building side FYI.The room was very nice - well decorated, very clean, larger. They provide complimentary bottled water every day also. Housekeeping at least 2x/day.We had breakfast in the restaurant once and although it was very good (great coffee, oatmeal with fruit, Nutella French toast), it was $50 for 2 people with tax and tip. We got coffee and oatmeal from Pete's and Philz all other days for breakfast. Philz coffee is a must-go if you love coffee and a few blocks away.The location was great - walking distance to Union Square, Chinatown, Ferry Building and Piers. Note that all are several blocks not just several yards away but the walks we're always good. Bring workout shoes and/flat shoes. The walls are great to walk off some of the AMAZING food.The biggest standout at the hotel was the service. The graciousness and attentiveness was excellent and first class. We did have a couple of hiccups on the room - the bathroom doornob came off and the water lever for the bath/shower was loose and feel to the hottest water setting. But we just called and both were fixed right away. We were greeted by everyone with so much friendliness and warmth. We will definitely be back to this hotel in the future and I would highly recommend to all!"
"My wife and I stayed at the Loews Regency San Francisco in November 2016. If you're looking for the best views in San Francisco then look no further. Aside from the stunning views though, the hotel itself and the staff within are truly second to none and must be experienced to be believed. I have an interesting story to tell - a little bit long but read on as I'm sure you'll get a feel for just how wonderful our experience was at Loews Regency :)I live in Sydney Australia with my beautiful wife and two little boys. Back in July I was trying to think of a nice way for us to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary. Right about the same time one of our favorite bands announced their first ever tour in 25 years, and they just happened to be playing in San Francisco on the night of our 10th wedding anniversary!! As this band had a lot to do with my wife and I getting together in the first place, I knew that I had to book tickets straight away, knowing it would strictly be a fly in / fly out scenario without kids for one night only (for a number of reasons, not the least of which was some time away by ourselves).So the scene was set - I had flights and concert tickets, but no accommodation. I'm writing this review for anyone else in the same situation, with some very clear advice. BOOK THIS HOTEL! It is really well located in the heart of the financial district, just a short cab or cable car ride to pretty much anywhere in the city.I spent some time reviewing other hotels on THE best advice community on the internet (TripAdvisor of course) and quickly came across some reviews for Loews Regency. Let me tell you, all of the positive reviews I've read couldn't prepare me for such a wonderful experience. I had the utmost pleasure dealing with Julia (Director of Leisure Sales) when booking our room. Of course I mentioned our story and Julia couldn't have been nicer to deal with. I knew I wanted a nice room with nice views as we were literally only going to be in the country for 38 hours. Julia promised that she would make the booking and request an upgrade for us on the night if one was available. So, after a 14 hour flight (one way mind you) we arrived at the Hotel a few hours earlier than expected, so we dropped our bags and went and had lunch at the Fog Harbor down in Pier 39 (great Clam Chowder by the way, if you're into that sort of thing). We got back to the hotel around 2pm and were told that not only was the room ready, but we had been upgraded to one of the best rooms in the Hotel - a Bridge to Bridge Suite no less!As you can imagine, for a couple of weary travelers, this was music to our ears. The timing could not have been more perfect as we got up to the room just in time to watch the Golden Gate Bridge get swallowed whole by the fog with minutes of our arrival (with complementary champagne in hand no less). The sweeping views of San Francisco Bay included the Golden Gate Bridge, the Trans-America Building (only a few blocks away), Alcatraz, the double-decker Bay Bridge and all points in between.What a great welcome, from the Concierge and Bell Attendants to the gentleman who showed us our room - none of them were discouraged from providing their top level of service even though we were in our comfy ""plane-ready"" clothing! :)Well, we waited in line at the concert, got a front row position and witnessed the best gig of our lives! We were a little too late by the time we called but even having the offer of the hotel car to come and pick us up was a really nice touch.When we got back to our room, our turn down service had happened and the staff had left some beautiful choc-dipped strawberries and a bottle of champagne! What a night :)When we woke up the next morning (very late as you could imagine), I'd forgotten to leave our request for breakfast on the door. No matter, our order for room service was delivered within minutes by a very friendly staff member explaining exactly how long he had brewed our tea! To sit in that room (4107 for reference) watching the world go by is something I'll never forget. The 12pm checkout time really allowed us to relax and get all our stuff ready for our shopping trip and the flight home that night.The team at Loews Regency present as a well-oiled machine that generates exceptional guest experiences. All of the front desk staff greeted us by name and knew exactly who we were and what our story was and it made us feel so welcome. They could not have been more attentive and we got the feeling they were actively interested in making our stay a memorable one. The view was utterly amazing and we truly felt like King and Queen of the world for a night and a morning. We will definitely be back to Loews Regency the first chance we get, and I could not recommend this hotel enough - 5 stars across the board! Special thanks to Julia, Emily, Laura, Michael, Bree, Rolando - you truly made our stay one that we will remember for the rest of our lives. Thank You!"
"I was blown away by everything at this amazing hotel: the bay view, showing the Golden Gate bridge in its entire glory on the 42nd floor, attention of staff, the food, both lunch and breakfast, amazing room experience, including the soft bed, comfortable robes, amazing staff...flowers, sweets, quality treats in the suite! This place is a dream come true. Reception is super helpful, showing you directions to sites, providing maps and water for the day.Breakfast is out of this world. The chef personslly asked me how many minutes/seconds I would like eggs to be boiled for, the menu is fresh, delicious and nothing is too much trouble. Green smoothies, fruit and vegetables are second to none, presentation is truly spectacular.I was in awe!!!? Thank you for my anazing stay here. I will be back soon.The location is great, as all sights inlcuding The Tate, cable car experience, museums are nearby. A must whilst in San Francisco."
"My husband and I stayed at the Loews Regency for a couple of nights and can’t say enough great things about our experience. If I could give it six stars I would! A couple months later and we are still talking about our stay. We travel a lot for work and for fun and this was hands down the BEST hotel we’ve ever stayed at. Not only is the hotel itself pristine and beautifully decorated, but what sets it apart is the AMAZING service. As soon as you set foot in the hotel, every single staff member is welcoming, friendly and helpful. They were more than eager to give us recommendations for restaurants, activities and even went out of their way to book us a car rental very last minute which they arranged to be conveniently dropped off at the hotel. Not only did they organize the car rental and drop off for us at a great rate, but by the time we walked down to the lobby all of our suitcases were loaded into the car. It’s the little touches that set this hotel and it’s staff apart. We were welcomed upon check-in with champagne and when we got to our room there was fruit and wine waiting for us. Our room was up on one of the top floors of the hotel with spectacular views of the city and the golden gate bridge. What’s great about the hotel is that no matter what room you get you will be on a high floor with a great view, so you can’t go wrong. The TV was large and the bed was insanely comfortable, we made sure to ask for the mattress brand so we can try and buy one for our house. The bathroom was stunning, with high end fixtures and great details. We sadly did not get a chance to try the restaurant but heard from other guests that the food was delicious. The hotel is in a prime location, close to lots of great shops and restaurants and a five minute walk to market street, one of the more popular destinations in SF. During our stay the hotel was hosting a free wine tasting at their penthouse suite which has a gigantic balcony with sweeping views of the city, arguably the best view around. The hotel will be renovating their lobby and rooms in the near future (not that they need it) so we are excited to go back to see the changes. Overall, we had an AMAZING experience and will definitely be back soon. If you are looking for a gorgeous hotel, in a great location with the best service imaginable, look no further, you will not be disappointed!"
I can't say enough about the staff at the Loews Regency. I ran an event there in February 2016 and everyone from the catering staff to the front desk were amazing. They made you feel like you were coming home. The views from the upper floors are also breathtaking!!! The rooms were beyond comfortable and the location can't be beat.
"Me and my wife had an unforgettable stay at the Loews Regency San Francisco. From start to finish the experience was amazing. Breathtaking iconic views from our ""Bridge to Bridge"" room. All staff very friendly. Concierge was helpful planning day activities and meals. I've been to several other properties in SF and this was our most memorable stay."
"I can't imagine how to tell you how to make it better when it was already an exquisite and relaxing stay at your beautiful hotel. Your staff was amazing! I arrived in San Francisco earlier than expected and contacted your front desk to ask for an earlier check-in which she replied absolutely. Once I arrived to check-in, she said well since you're checking in early you were originally in a king room with a bay view but since you're here early... and I said uh oh I can wait if I'm not able to get into a bay view. She said ""oh no we were able to upgrade you to a corner room with a view of both bridges - the Golden gate AND the bay bridge"" which absolutely sent me to the moon. You hotel is amazing and the views from that room were incredible. Thanks for making my stay in San Francisco truly memorable. Also as I was checking out EARLY for Pacific time people, your staff was amazing once again. I needed to get to the airport around 5 or 5:30am and I called down to the front desk around 4am and he said we have your cab waiting so feel free to come down whenever you're ready. As I walked down into the lobby, he said my name (probably bc no one was up this early besides me) and immediately ushered me to my cab. I truly felt like a princess at your hotel and will definitely look to stay at your wonderful hotel when I return. "
"Amazing experience all along.I had to change my reservation last minute and despite the fact that it was an online non changeable fare, the staff were super understanding and flexible.The room was spacious, comfortable, beautifully decorated and had a breathtaking view.I mentioned at reception that I had caught a cold in the plane: they came to deliver herbal tea and honey+ something for the headache.Finally, it was was birthday and I was really made feel special: champagne, chocolate, and everyone kept on wishing me a happy birthday.Food, in room service, spa we're all just incredible The experience was very luxurious, the staff is remarkably lovely and the facilities are amazing; I would so highly recommend it!"
"I was in San Francisco on business for two days. I am really happy I stayed at this hotel. The views from my room were breathtaking. The room seemed to be recently renovated because it was modern and beautiful. The fundamentals were all great: very comfortable bed, excellent bathroom (especially the modern shower), and walls thick enough to provide a quiet night's sleep.My business colleagues and I had breakfast one morning in the restaurant on the first floor and it was quite good, with a large assortment of breakfast choices.Finally the service at the reception desk was excellent. The staff were friendly, but did not go overboard. They hit just the right balance.If you choose this hotel, you will pay a premium price, typical of San Francisco. So, insist on a room as high as possible to take advantage of the views. I was on 44 and looked at the Transamerica Tower, Alcatraz Island, and the Golden Gate Bridge off in the distance.Next time I am in San Francisco for pleasure, my wife and I will definitely try to stay at the Leows Regency. It was that good."
"We've stayed here twice before when it was the Mandarin, and Lowe's has preserved its best qualities. It has the feel of a smaller property with very personal attention and consideration for the quests comfort.The views as mentioned frequently are exceptional, and both the tourist and business traveler are equally happy here. It's a place where we end up spending more time in our room than expected and wouldn't even know there's anyone else in the house."
Staff is professional and the views are beautiful. Overall it was a nice hotel. In my opinion this is not a 5 star hotel. The food restaurant in the hotel was barely edible. I tried octopus and ahi tartare and they were equally bellow average.
"We spent 4 nights at this hotel. Staff were very efficient and friendly, particularly the concierge Michael. Rooms were spacious with a particularly comfortable bed. Everything was spotlessly clean but the highlight was undoubtedly the views. From the bedroom we could see across the piers into the bay, with one of our rooms (we had a short break to Yosemite) looking towards the Golden Gate Bridge and across to Alcatraz and the other towards the Bay Bridge. We had breakfast twice in the hotel restaurant where the food and service were fine but the atmosphere was lacking. The only criticism relates to the courtesy car. We hadn't been able to book it for returns from the restaurants. On one occasion we phoned and it was not available so we got a cab. On the other we were told it would be with us in 12 minutes but 20 minutes later it had not arrived - on phoning again we were told it would be 45 minutes - we walked back. Both times when we returned to the hotel the car and chauffeur were both there! We did mention this and the hotel were very apologetic. We would stay here again and have no hesitation in recommending it."
"From the minute I arrived and the bellman knew my name, I knew this was going to be a great place to stay. Staff trained by the Mandarin Hotel group and it shows. Chris at the front desk got me a great room because I needed quiet. A 10 on the Walk Score and the food is good. Really like the spa facial I had."
"We have made the round of high end hotels over the years. We did not stay at this site when it was Manadrin. But that is old news and this is the real deal. One must if possible stay in a corner suite with views of Bay bridge and Golden Gate. Historical landmarks visible all around us from this lofty perch. Awake to sea the juggernaut class shipliners make their way down the bay. View Alcatraz Island with its convoluted fascinating history. Coit Tower, Bank of America, the edifice with the corporate goddesses, Peter and Paul Basilica the Pier, all visible clearly from our vantage. Fitness room pristine. Staff beyond cordial. My spouse loved the location of the tub with the huge picture window. We did not eat at onsite restaurant as we love to fine the unique eateries when in SF. Short walk to Ferry Building one side and Union Square in the other direction. And they opened view balconies Friday for guests. Quite a site, to be enjoyed with complimentary wine. Pricey, but what isn't these days in SF. Prepare for first class service if you do go."
"We booked the hotel because of the view, the known quality of the gymn at loews and the coffe machine in the room, although in that league not uncommon to have. We did not find the coffe machine and although promised to be delivered immediately, after more than an hour it didi not come. There were other service issues and the manager promised us a free breakfast, which we accepted. But inthe end, we had to pay for the breakfast. Not a commendable performance at all."
The staff of this property are very efficient and friendly and go out of their way to be accommodating. The shortcomings are the shower stall does not have a handheld unit and the shower head position is such that it's very hard in the size of the stall to rinse off for a tall person. The bathroom has very little counterspace and no drawers or cabinets so for two people it's necessary to have toiletries on the floor or on the shelf surrounding the tub.
"I recently stayed two nights at the Loews and was incredibily impressed with the service I received. My room was huge and was really well equiped - including an iron and ironing board. The only thing which would have been great was a coffee machine.The staff were super friendly and nothing was too much hassle. They even waved me off when I left.As the Loews is in the financial district, Im sure its primarily a business hotel, but it was fantastic for a weekend visit. They even have a complimentary wine tasting on their terrace on the 40th floor on Friday and Saturday. I met some really interesting people there.I will return to San Fran and I will be staying at the Loews."
"Most people stay here for the views but unless you are lucky the views you get are totally a random happenstance so you can't count on what you booked/requested.There is too much variability between the quality of the views within a category of room so you may have a ""Bridge to Bridge"" room on the eastern edge on the lowest, 38th, floor, in which case your views are through gaps in tall buildings nearby....or you could be on the western edge on the top, 48th floor, and enjoy sweeping views from the Golden Gate to the Bay Bridge.....they'll tell you that you have the 48th ,but when you arrive you find you are on the 38th and they pull out that old saw - ""we can't guarantee a specific room"" despite saying on two previous calls that you are reserved a room on their 46th floor......the only reason you select this hotel is the view so if they can't guarantee a good view and that is important to you - then you should book elsewhere. Fairmont for instance sub-categorizes their Tower rooms by which floor ( and hence, what view) the room/suite is located."
"Selected this hotel for a surprise birthday / anniversary trip for my wife. There are so many great hotels, however the hotel's rooms start on the 38th floor and therefore we expected to have a nice view of the city. From the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out, we received the most amazing service. Every effort is made to ensure guests feel welcomed and catered to. The concierge was always welcoming and was exceptionally helpful. The drinks at the bar were artfully and tastefully prepared. These are just a few of the reasons that made our stay incredibly memorable.Our thanks to the staff and our highest recommendation to anyone looking for luxurious accommodations with outstanding service!"
"We've stayed at Loews hotels in other cities before and have always had wonderful experiences, but this one really exceeded our expectations. Everyone from the doorman to the bartender was very kind and helpful, and could not have provided more top notch service. Our room was fantastic (if you're going to stay here, get a bay view room), and the location of the hotel is perfect for exploring San Francisco. We can't wait to return!"
"I don't normally gush about a hotel stay, but I feel like I'm going to in this review. My husband and I stayed two nights here at the end of one of my work trips to the city. From the moment we approached the doors at check-in until the moment we left, the experience was flawless. The location, in the Financial District, is close to the Embarcadero as well as the Montgomery Street BART station. While it is a little quiet during the weekend evenings, it is very central. We ubered to North Beach and the Presidio and none of the trips cost over $20. The lobby is very intimate; so if you're expecting a sweeping grandiose lobby like the St. Francis, you may not be prepared for the immaculate rooms. (By the way, the doormen and check-in staff are warm but efficient, getting you squared away as soon as possible.) Our spacious junior suite was, hands down, one of the most comfortable hotel rooms I've ever stayed in. There was a small upholstered bench behind the door and the room then opened up to contain a king bed, desk with a chair on either side, a comfortable love seat, coffee table, and a sideboard with a flat screen on top. Every seating surface felt like something you would want to sink into after a long day. The bed was extremely comfortable, so much so that I had a hard time motivating myself to get up to explore. And the bathroom... A large soaking tub with a view of Watts Tower and Alcatraz. The stand-up shower had perfect water pressure. And the toiletries are larger than average (remember to leave room in your TSA approved ziploc because you will want to take them home). We arranged to use their car service to take us to our dinner reservations and our driver was a delight. And really, the service here is top notch. I did not get a chance to visit their spa unfortunately. I am struggling to find any negative aspect to complain about - so the only thing I will say is that the doors to the terrace on the 40th floor with the amazing view of the Transamerica Building was locked so the photos didn't turn out. I stay in SF a lot for work and believe me, if I could get my company to pay for it, I would stay here every time I came to the city. But I will definitely be back for another trip with my husband, on my own dime, because it was just that special."
"I was in two minds about booking this hotel, as yes, it's currently the 2nd best in San Francisco but my trip was already on the pricey side and I wasn't sure I could afford the extra. I'm so glad I did splash out, this hotel is more than worth it. Upon arrival after an 11 hour flight, the staff were welcoming, friendly, helpful and polite. We were informed that there was the Weekend Winedown beginning in just over an hour which was the perfect introduction to the hotel and city ever - sipping fizz while looking out at the amazing views from the open Sky Bridge on level 40. The room was a generous size and had all the amenities we could wish for: separate bath and shower, plenty of towels, complimentary bottled water, ample storage space, a seating area and desk, plus the bay view from our 42nd floor room was phenomenal. We booked a Superior Room with a king bed and bay view. If I am ever in San Francisco again this hotel will most definitely be my first choice."
"My husband and I stayed here for three nights while we explored beautiful San Francisco. From before we checked in the staff were helpful. The concierge team were happy to answer questions and organize Alcatraz tickets for us. The doorman raced across the street to rescue us and our luggage from where we were unceremoniously dumped by our shuttle driver and check in was a breeze. Our room on the 48th floor was breathtaking! Beautifully decorated, huge, and with unforgettable views. Everything was thought of at Loews, from complimentary water in the rooms, to chocolates with the turn down service, to bowls of complimentary fruit in the lobby. Everytime we left the hotel, we were offered more bottled water to take on our adventures and more often than not were addressed by name. We also sampled the room service menu, and the food was fantastic. I cannot speak highly enough of this hotel. If I could give more than a 5 star rating, Loews Regency San Francisco would deserve it!"
"This hotel is very conveniently located, offering amazing views of the bay and with very friendly staff and amenities. You can easily walk to any point of interest or take advantage of the abundant public transportation.Highly recommended."
"This hotel has great service and amazing views from up high. Expansive views from the golden gate bridge to the bay bridge, depending on where your room is located. The bathroom has a tub located at the window so you can enjoy the view while you bathe! Doormen, bellmen, concierge and front desk staff are always greeting you as you arrive and/or depart."
"Overall Summary – 5/5 The Loews Regency San Francisco was a perfect choice for our stay in the beautiful City by the Bay. We stayed for four nights in a deluxe king city view room and the views of the city from the 42nd floor were outstanding. The staff here do an excellent job across the board, making their guests feel welcome and offering that personal touch that sets them apart from the competition. All aspects of this hotel which we encountered during our stay were exemplary.Finding the Hotel – 4/5 My partner and I travelled from San Francisco International Airport by train, alighting at the Embarcadero stop, which is around 6 minutes on foot from the hotel. The train took roughly 30 minutes and cost just under $9 for a one way trip. The hotel is very easy to find once you get used to the layout of the city. As we were first time visitors, it took us around 15 minutes after an initial wrong turning on my part!Location Location Location! – 4.5/5 The Loews Regency is located on the cusp of San Francisco’s Financial District in a safe and populated (but not over-populated) location. Public transportation is quickly accessible nearby if you prefer to make your own way around a new city as we do but I also gather that the concierges at this hotel do a fantastic job in arranging transportation for their customers.How were the Staff? – 5/5 From the warm welcome we received to the goodbyes at checkout time, the staff of Loews Regency San Francisco took care of us very well. That personal touch that I mentioned previously really does enhance the experience of staying there and nothing was ever too much trouble.How was the Room? – 5/5 Our room afforded stunning city views and was spacious and very tastefully furnished. Although our deluxe king city view room wasn’t classed as one of the hotel’s ‘suites’, it provided the space and amenities of many suites that I have stayed in previously. The bed was large and comfortable and I got used to it quickly so sleep was easy to come by. There was also quite a large table, couch, workstation, chairs and fridge/mini bar. The climate control worked well (thankfully, as we arrived in San Francisco at the beginning of a heatwave) and the lighting in the room was able to be controlled to achieve just the right ambience. The bathroom was immaculate, stylishly designed and contained more than enough space. There was an evening turn down service which also included complimentary bottled water, refilling the ice bucket (again, much appreciated due to the heat) and leaving complimentary chocolates with a little card which contained an image and a quote relating to the city which we thought was a nice touch. Foodie Review – N/AWe almost always like to make a point of eating at the restaurant of any hotel we stay in on at least one of the nights but unfortunately, on this occasion, we were unable to attend our reservation at the Brasserie S&P, which is the hotel’s restaurant. Our reservation was removed courteously and this is now something that we can experience when we return to Loews Regency. We passed the restaurant on many occasions when entering the hotel and it looked like somewhere we would enjoy dining.Anything Else?We would highly recommend this great city and this superb hotel to anyone. We will certainly return to San Francisco and staying at Loews Regency again, will not even need to be a decision."
The Loews Regency makes you feel like you're in a boutique hotel. The staff is warm and professional. The rooms are at the top floors and offer amazing vistas of the city. Luxurious bathrooms and the best beds ever. They're my first choice when traveling to SF. Great business center and cafe also. 
"I suppose I should had low expectations given how low a rate I paid for this ""5-star"" hotel. It's the small things that make a truly great experience, and that's how this place was lacking. I came here w my hubs for a long weekend layover before my honeymoon in Asia. Though we told them it was our honeymoon, there was no acknowledgement, not even a word at reception. Hm. Here were the other hits and misses:Pros:- Centrally located in the financial district, it's a 5 min walk to the Embarcadero and ferry building, and an easy 15 min walk to Union Square. It's easy to get a taxi, jump on a cable car. The location was all in all very convenient. - Staff was always very friendly and helpful- Rooms were quiet on the weekend, don't know if there was a rowdy crowd outside my door or not, it was so quiet and peaceful. - The bed was very comfortable, I would take it home with me if I couldCons:- No pool or hot tub (I came here on a weekend when it was 85 degrees out). Just saying, it would have been nice. - We ordered room service for dinner and breakfast. The meals were basic, but not up to par. The salad was way overdressed and salty, the pizza was clearly a fresh baked, previously frozen cardboard disk. The breakfast burrito was incredibly bland. The saving grace was the smoked salmon platter, which was fresh and delicious. - Housekeeping was fine, the room was definitely very clean. Turndown service was basically chocolates thrown on the duvet. My biggest peeve was that they would remove all the dirty towels and robes, the. Replace them with a robe & slippers & towels for 1 person, when clearly 2 people were staying there. - Very low water pressure in the shower, not great for basic things, like washing hair. I couldn't get my whole head wet just from standing under the shower. The tub was deep and great for soaking, but the slow stream took for.ever. to fill the tub. It was a 3.5 star experience, and I would stay here again mostly out of convenience. For a romantic weekend at a 5-star hotel? Go elsewhere. Tip:Parking is $70 if you valet, but you can park in the separately run parking garage under the hotel for $15-$40/day (depending on weekday/weekend rates). "
We stayed 2 nights here in a Bay View (Bridge to bridge) suite and would highly recommend to anyone! The view from our high floor room was simply breathtaking. The bathroom had floor to ceiling windows with the bay view which was great for a late night bubble bath for 2 (great for any special occasion). The hotel completely deserves its 5 star rating. It's located within walking distance of lots of things to do and visit. They were very kind in accommodating the bikes we rented to cross Golden Gate Bridge over night. 
"We stayed at the Loews for a few days to celebrate my wife's 40th birthday and we were blown away by the rooms and the hospitality at the Loews. Every staff member including the general manager, front desk, concierge and the room service team was polite and extremely helpful. They added some special touches to make our trip memorable. We had a fantastic stay at the Loews. Thank you to the entire team for making it special."
"This was our first luxury hotel on vacation as a couple so we were both extremely happy going in, but all around the service and rooms were phenomenal. We both had been to 5 star luxury hotels before and have a lot of travel experience for people in their 20's.Bottom Line: Views + Service + Room Decor + Free Upgrade + Check-in 3 hrs. early lead me to rate it 5 stars for a 1 night stay.We had the Superior City View room, but got bumped up to a Deluxe King (at no extra cost) on the 46th floor after a very polite woman allowed us to check in 3 hours early. The views were breathtaking, as to be expected from a tall 5-star hotel. The room was a beautiful room, but I give a 5 star ranking for it's decor on white washed furniture, comfortable sofa, very comfortable linens, sitting room near the door and a bathtub that could actually fit two people. We enjoyed also how your ears popped on the quick elevator to the top :)Lastly, most deserving of 5 stars was the service. The concierge and lobby employee recommended a seafood restaurant (Tadich's Grill) and were able to get us in front of the reservation line there! We saved about 45 minutes of waiting and it was a huge relief after a long day. On top of that, after a homeless man had walked in and tried to sit in the small lobby area, the doorman gently and nicely ushered him out. Previous stays at different hotel chains NYC and Boston haven't shown patience like such.I did not get reimbursed or paid for my review, nor did I try any of the amenities (yoga, spa, etc..) that were available beyond the concierge help. I stayed 1 night. I cannot comment on the location quality thoroughly (we were tourists), however it was close to 2 BART stops which made traveling to the suburbs the next day easier."
"We booked Loews Regency due to its excellent reviews and the views, for 3 nights. It is in the financial district and a quick 30 mins from the airport. Check in was super quick and friendly. There was one lift under repair when we visited so it took a little time to get a lift at different times. Our room was not ready on arrival so we wer offered a drink in the bar. We visited the bar a few times over the weekend and found the service to be attentive and friendly. However the bar does lack in atmosphere and is defiantly a business bar first. The room ( we had a bay to bay room) had a magnificent view, unbeatable in the area. And the bed was well positioned to make the most of the fabulous view. However I did feel like the room needed a refurb. The chair had stains on it, the carpet had seen better days and the bathroom was neither modern nor grand. All mod cons were available and the toiletries were nice. The bed was very comfortable and the shore was good. We had room service one evening which was excellent. We used the hotel car on several occasions for dinner reservations and both the doorman and the driver were excellent, always remembering your name and asking how dinner was.Overall for the price of the hotel and having just come from a week in Vegas we were a little disappointed with the standard of the room, however the service was truly outstanding and the views were amazing. It just depends on what you want from your hotel."
"My husband and I spent our wedding night at this amazing hotel, and we loved it! I am from the Bay Area and had always wanted to stay in a luxury hotel in San Francisco so when I was looking for hotels for after our wedding, the Loews caught my eye for a number of reasons. I definitely wanted views of the city, and with this being the third tallest building in SF, I knew we had a good shot of getting a great view! Plus, it had wonderful reviews and the quality looked really nice based on pictures and descriptions on the website. We got to the hotel around 10:30pm and were greeted by an extremely kind staff. We got the keys to our room while our luggage was brought up separately. Our room was a standard king with bay view, and even at night, the view was amazing. We could see part of the bay bridge and surrounding buildings. Our room itself was simple, but stunning. We had both a shower and a soaking tub and the bathroom was perfect. Our bed was very comfortable and lighting felt nice. I wish we could have stayed longer! This hotel certainly exudes luxury and is wonderful for those that want to celebrate a special occasion and splurge a little bit, it is worth it!"
We stepped out of our usual neighborhood of San Francisco to try the Loews Regency in the financial district. It sits above an office building encompassing the 38th through 48th floors. You can imagine the beautiful views that you can see from your room overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge. It's even possible on the other side of the hotel to see the Bay Bridge.The staff at Loews are so professional and are there to make sure your stay with them is perfect. Even before we arrived we were in communication with Calvin in the concierge department numerous times. He made all our dinner reservations and made sure the hotel car was able to take us to dinner and pick us up when we were done.As far as the rooms are concerned they have the view and of course are decorated beautifully. We were very pleased with our accommodations and the class of service the Loews Regency is known for.We will definitely come back again in the near future.
Stayed for a few days on a work trip. Nice views from my room on the 43rd floor. No gym as far as I can tell. Brasserie does nice breakfast and lunch and doubles as a bar in the evening. Cheerful and friendly service. Room nice with generous bathroom etc 
"We had a relaxing, lovely couple of days here. The weather in the city was particularly cold and gray, so it was really nice to relax in our bridge-to-bridge view room. The panorama was fantastic. Everything was nice, from the check-in (complete with a glass of champagne) to check-out (they were kind enough to keep our bags for several hours before our evening flight). The room was spotless, the staff very accommodating at all times, the hotel was quiet and the location made it pretty easy to get to all points of the city, whether by taxi or hotel-provided town car, BART or foot. I would definitely stay here again."
"Everything about this hotel was near perfect. Very attentive staff who made an effort to learn your name and understand your needs. Beautiful generously sized suites, well isolated rooms where you can really avoid the traffic noise of the city. Super confortable beds and great bathrooms (ours had a bathtub with a view). Great room service, great valet service. I will come back and would definitely recommend it."
"My wife and I took a trip to San Fran for her birthday and from the start of the trip, the Loews staff made the entire stay a great experience. The check-in was quick and the rooms had an amazing view (arguable one of the best views in the city). During our check-in we mentioned that it was my wife's birthday so one evening when we returned from exploring the city, we were greeted by chocolates, strawberries, and a bottle of champagne were on the table (I wish I could have taken credit for it, however this was all done by the Loews staff without me saying a word). Truly thoughtful and clearly shows how much they go above and beyond.Aside from the amazing staff, the hotel is located in the heart of the city so it is easy to get to main areas or any transportation needed. The guest services group was also very accommodating as we usually started our morning talking to them for recommendations.I would recommend Loews to anyone as they provided an experience that will always stick in our memories."
Spent a wonderful week at Loews Regency. Excellent service with the best breakfast. Our room was spacious with a view to die for. Recommend as well visit again. Close to all of the City sites. Highly recommend!
"It was my husband's birthday and I was looking for a really special place to spend it. SF is his favourite city so I decide to surprise him with the trip there, it took quite a lot of googling to find a perfect place to stay and I'm so glad I chose the Loews Regency! every member of staff there was so friendly , attentive and professional Because of the special occasion we were upgraded to one of the best suits there with magnificent view of 2 bridges, Alcatraz and Colt tower. And as a birthday treat we received champagne , strawberries and chocolates with written card to the birthday boyLocation was great as well, so next time in SF it'll definetly be Loews Regency again"
"This was truly a 5 star experience. It started with the nice greeting from the doorman and very friendly and accommodating ladies at the front desk. Once we got to our room we were blown away at the view. We had just come from The Coit Tower, and honestly our view from the room was even better! I had told the ladies at the front desk that my husband was treating me to a weekend with them because it was my birthday, so when we returned from our afternoon out, there was champagne, strawberries, and a chocolate bar that said Happy Birthday. Also, the location was perfect. We toured quite a bit of the city, and it was either walking distance, trolley, or cheap Uber/Lyft ride everywhere. The service was impeccable from start to finish. I will defiantly stay at the Lowes Regency San Francisco again, as well as NYC if it is as wonderful as this experience."
"I read others' positive reviews of this hotel and all I can say is, I wholeheartedly concur! We just visited for one night (to celebrate our wedding anniversary), but everything was lovely. When they learned it was our anniversary, they upgraded our room (41st floor with a gorgeous view of the Bay Bridge) and even sent up a split of champagne and some chocolate-covered strawberries with a handwritten note. Talk about a nice surprise! We also ate in the lobby restaurant and the food was terrific. Ahi poke was fresh, the rack of lamb perfectly cooked and spiced, and the steak was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I wasn't thrilled about the neighborhood when we made our reservation, but we had a lovely stroll on the Embarcadero; it was almost like we were tourists!"
"If you can, try to get moved up to a room that has views of both bridges. Perhaps the most gorgeous view from any spot in San Francisco. Perfectly frames Alcatraz with the Transamerica pyramid in the foreground. The room was well furnished even though the bath looked a bit dated. Everything perfectly clean and in working order."
"This is truly a 5 star hotel. The BEST customer service I have ever experienced in a hotel. The hotel is located very close to Union Square without the hassle and bustle of union square. The hotel is also located on the 38-48th floors of this building which means you will have a fantastic view no matter what room you're in! The staff also treated us very well with a treat in the room for our baby moon, a very nice touch! I will return!"
"We were expecting a lot from Loews given the great ratings and made it our first stop on our honeymoon. Frankly one of the more disappointing 5 star hotels I've stayed at. Apart from the great views, friendly staff and convenient location it had nothing more to offer. The place has a very business only vibe to it. The hotel has only one restaurant, a bar that closes at around 10pm, no coffee shop or patisserie, a very average lounge area, no swimming pool and a very basic spa. The bay view room had that - a great Bay view but nothing else. It was pretty bog-standard, quite small and did not feel premium. I was surprised that it did not even have a selection of hot beverage options and a coffee maker - may be this is a European thing. Basically, if you are a non-business traveller I'm sure there must be better places to splurge out in SF. I have clients in the financial district and would return on work. On personal visits however I'd stay clear of Loews. "
I understand this was the Mandarin up until a year or so ago and it feels like it's still working up to being a 5 star hotel. It's one of the Fine Hotels association and as 'members via AMEX' we believed we received a room upgrade but were never sure that we did. We had the one room having paid for the top non-suite room so we were a bit confused by what we paid for. The room was very comfortable. The restaurant is small and I wonder if the hotel needs a second cafe or similar. It is very well situated in the Financial District so there are plenty of eateries near by. The service was fine but I sensed was lacking a little in confidence which added to the '5-star in training' feel about the hotel.I don't think I'll return to Loews if I return to San Francisco as there are many other good hotels to choose from. 
This is a typical big city hotel. The views from all rooms are amazing. San Fran can often be overcast which is a shame but it is still incredible.The restaurant feels like they are trying too hard. The seats are too big though which makes you feel odd sitting in them.So if you like big city hotels this one ticks all the boxes.
"Loews Regency in SF has the best customer service we have ever experienced at any hotel. From the moment we checked in they rolled out the red carpet. After the first time we walked in all of the staff called us by name, the staff knew what we wanted before we even did, the staff (especially Calvin and Paul) were very knowledgeable and friendly and the views from our room were stunning. The room itself was very large and upscale with a gorgeous bathroom. We were surprised with champagne and chocolate covered strawberries for our anniversary which was such a nice touch. The gym was way beyond what most hotels offer and the restaurant was delicious. We were so sad when we had to check out having felt so pampered during our whole stay. If we return to SF we will definitely be staying at Loews again. "
Me and my partner stayed here for 5 nights whilst on vacation. I called ahead and spoke to Calvin who organised airport transportation for us. We where greeted at the airport by a very professional driver and whisked to the hotel. On arriving at the hotel the car door was opened by hotel staff and we were greeted by our names. Luggage all taken in and a glass of champagne waiting for us at reception whilst we checked in - within 5 minutes we were being accompanied to our room with our luggage and then a guided tour of our suite - 4306 has Bridge to Bridge views. Local knowledge on where to go and what to do was excellent. Room facilities were excellent - well stocked bar with lots of treats and a pair of binoculars go appreciate the views. We were offered the use of the house car to go locally which was superb. We had in room dining one night as we were so tired after a full day of sightseeing - again excellent service. Breakfast in the room one morning was lovely - pancakes to die for! Marianne assisted us in booking a restaurant too. Staff went the extra mile constantly and took the time to chat and get to know you a little. Too many people to name but everyone was great and made our stay in San Francisco even better. THE place to stay in San Fran! Well done Loews! 
The spa flows over into the guest rooms. Robes and slippers and the bath stocked with very nice products. Centrally located you can venture into the city feeling refreshed. The beds are very soft and the sheets are silky with a nice choice of pillows. 
"We had a very nice stay at the Loews Regency. Really liked the location as well. Its in the Financial District or Downtown but everything is close enough near by. San Francisco doesn't have just one area or neighborhood with everything in it - it has various areas. Service was excellent. It was our anniversary and they bumped the room to a higher floor and also had some complimentary champagne and a tasty chocolate plate. Concierge were very helpful each time we asked something. They also had a free wine sampling happy hour on Friday and Saturday on the floor that has the observation decks. By the way, the observation decks are a nice location for a small wedding or party with amazing views. We saw a wedding taking place during our stay.Rooms were very nice and clean. Bathrooms almost all marble. Our room had both a nice bath and big shower with accessories like a blow dryer.The hotel restaurant is the Brasserie S&P which is located at ground level and actually open to the reception (which was kind of noisy at times). We had breakfast there one morning. Somewhat expensive but the food was very good. The bar is there as well and looked like a good gathering spot. We didn't use the exercise, spa or business center so can't say much about them.Overall was a very nice, comfortable stay at Loews Regency."
"Best part of our stay were the bridge to bridge views from our room. With so much of San Francisco spread out below us, it was dazzling. The room itself was large & attractive & the staff were helpful & pleasant. Location was excellent, one could walk to the Ferry Terminal & hail a cable car a half block away. The lobby was rather small & unappealing & the bar closed rather early for our tastes. But, in general, this hotel is a good choice for sightseers."
"Had a fabulous time while staying here last week! The room had champagne and chocolates upon arrival. I had to work from the hotel room for two days and I loved everything in the room, including the desk right next to the windows with an outstanding view! Great room service and food. I told my husband I felt like royalty while saying here :)."
"The views make this hotel! Our room was spacious and clean, but our overall experience, although thoroughly enjoyable, wasn't quite 5 star. Firstly we only reached the hotel on the third attempt after sending two emails asking for clarification on our booking, neither of which was responded to. Then we discovered that our room had no kettle - a first world problem, I admit, but we do enjoy brewing our own in the morning. Wifi is only free if you opt for the slower service, which given the price of the rooms was a surprise. Lastly, the hotel doesn't seem to make much of its major asset - the views. There is no reataurant or bar at the top, and the fitness centre is on the third floor and viewless. Despite all these criticisms, the hotel is a major addition to the SF hotel scene."
"Everything was perfect. Service was outstanding. The driver, Danny was amazing. 5 star without a doubt! Perfect view of San Francisco. The chocolate was a nice little surprise. Couldn't of asked for a better vacation."
"We stopped at Loews Regency San Francisco for 3 nights. The service and attention shown by the staff was top notch. Breakfast was really good. I was pleasantly surprised by the croissant, and I lived 11 years in France! Well done to all and thank you."
"The exception to the rule about the disappointing SF hotel scene - lovely hotel with glorious views from every room and every angle (I had a Bay View which was superb, but I saw standard city view rooms and there really wasn't a dud - some of the ""city"" views included the bay too). It helps that it's (apparently) the tallest accommodation tower in San Francisco. My suite was a good size, incredibly comfortable, flooded with light from windows all around, and with a vast bathroom including a tub overlooking Alcatraz. Staff were a cut above the norm - you can tell that most of them were trained in its days as the Mandarin Oriental. I stayed over a weekend when the Financial District was quiet, which I loved, and being away from the Union Square melée was a bonus. The sky deck has unbelievable views over the Bay (though limited opening hours) - they do free wine receptions on the weekend which is a lovely touch.The only letdown was breakfast - overpriced and IMO mediocre food, but other than that it was pretty much faultless. I'll be back."
"We were in room 4105 with a bay to bridge view. The room was perfect and the view unbelievable. The entire staff went out of their way to make everything perfect. The concierge, Michael, went out of his way to provide restaurants at prime times with great food and wonderful views. I have been lucky to stay in some great hotels and the Loew's Regency ranks among the best. Kudos to Loew's for maintaining and improving on a great hotel."
"When we made our reservation, we were promised a room above the 40th floor. When we arrived we were informed that all of the rooms above the lowest floor were already assigned. But we were assured that the room that we had been assigned had been freshly renovated and had the identical view to the room that we had reserved. You know what? It was true. Promising, that we would be above the 40th floor, and then failing to deliver on that promise, set us up for disappointment. I kept Loews at 3 stars because of check-in. We arrived about 1:30 pm. A little early for the official check-in time, but certainly not grossly so. I literally cannot count the number of times I have gotten off an overnight flight to Europe, arrived at a hotel as early as 9:00 am--as often as not without a reservation--been promised that they would expedite cleaning a room, and been in my room by 9:30 am. Well, at 1:30 pm, Loews promised that they would expedite cleaning a room. We sat in the lobby and watched customer after customer being escorted to their rooms. At 3:00 pm, their expediting still had not occurred. I approached the front desk and inquired when we might expect to be shown to our room. The front desk clerk, smartly, informed me that check-in time was at 3:00 pm. I held-up my iPad on the clock function showing that the time of day was 3:00 pm, and asked again, when my room would be ready. We were told that all that remained was for the hotel to organize their minibar. In other words, we were being held-up for hotel to prep their in-room sales presentation, in which we had zero interest.Since this review is somewhat harsh, I feel that it might be useful to share the calculus that I use in rating lodging establishments. Over the past 12 years of writing these reviews, I have tried to develop some rules for my evaluations. First rule is that every establishment starts out as an average of three stars. Second rule is that luxury establishments compete against other luxury lodging, and conversely economy lodging, where I might stay with my dog when we attend competitions, is evaluated against its competition. To move up to four stars, I must be impress. (And again what it takes to impress me depends on the class of establishment. At an economy lodge, I might be impressed that clerk acts like an owner and treats me like a valued customer. At a luxury hotel I might be impressed that the bellman showing me to my room relays my mentioning an attraction I might want to visit, and the concierge calls with my options, almost before the door closes on the bellman leaving.) To move up to five stars I must be pleasantly surprised by something. And, of course, it works in reverse. If I am disappointed you are going to lose a star. If I am grossly disappointed, or negatively surprised, you drop another star.Loews disappointed me by announcing, as I checked-in, that they had given someone else the room we rented (one on the 40th floor or higher). But I decided that should be zeroed-out since substantively it made no difference. But they disappointed me again by promising that they would expedite cleaning my room, and failed to do so. Their staff exasperated the issue when I inquired when my room might be ready, after waiting an hour and 30 minutes for their version of expedited cleaning, and they smarted-off to me that check-in time is at 3:00 pm, even though it was then 3:00 pm. So they were now at 2 stars.A series of subtly impressive events redeemed the star lost at check-in. First, and this starts with our initial reservation, the reservationist recommended the Bridge to Bridge room, instead of a Bridge to Bridge suite. I was a tad skeptical about whether we had made the right decision. But when we were shown the room, I was genuinely impressed. The room had plenty of space for the two of us for an overnight stay. And it even included a very adequate sitting area. And I will tell you a secret, our night at the Loews was the least expensive of our 7-night San Francisco/Napa tour. Second, the bellman addressed us by name every time he saw us. And lastly the concierge sent us a champaign aperitif at the restaurant where he had made our dinner reservation. (I am not so naive that I don't realize that the restaurant was happy to comp a couple of Proseccos for a reliable concierge. But it was nonetheless delightful.) While it was so foggy that we could barely see the Bay bridge, when were finally showed to our room at 3:18, and we were too late--fog wise--to ever see the Golden Gate, but nonetheless, I can recommend the Loews for its views. And unless you really need the space, the Bridge to Bridge rooms are plenty big for a short stay.I do have a suggestion for the housekeeping manager. Loews did offer a nice selection of grooming amenities. But in an effort to shave costs, the included toothbrush and swabs are so flimsy as to be virtually unusable. If he doesn't know where to locate usable amenities, I can refer him to Hotel Drisco down the street, or to the provisions manager at Delta Airlines who provide usable amenities in their International Business Class kits."
"This review is based on my purpose of having family time during the event of The San Francisco Marathon. My priority was to be close by where the event ends.Now, based on the room assigned for the reservation, the location is the unique spot that provide view of bay bridge, Alcatraz, and city streets and building from the top. The hotel is at almost at border of financial district and downtown (to picture, Hyatt Regency San Francisco is at approximately two blocks and half away, China Town bordering North Beach walking distance 15 min if you are adult and travelling without infants-toddlers).  I would consider the location close to good spot as is close by and not too far from many interested spot of the city. For instance if the priority is downtown and shopping area, for that would be suggested hotels nearby Union Square.From category of hotel perspective, the hotel room seems to fit to the luxury category. It is totally quiet (although you do get to hear sirens of ambulance, but not room next door or floor). The space was well organized to camouflage nicely the small space. But what will impress you is the view. At floor 40th, there are access to the balcony and give a sense that can touch the cloud or the sky. For those focused in Embarcadero area and high end hotels in the immediate area are Hotel Vitale, Harbor Court, Hyatt Regency, Le Meridien. To give a spatial sense, little away from Financial District in toward to downtown, there are Four Seasons, St Regis, Ritz Carlton, to mention some. But LR hotel seems quite better located if you are one of participant of the marathon as it allow high quality room, then have access to china town and north beach restaurants on addition to the Embarcadero market place, then easy return for relax after long running event and have view from the top where you were running. LR does give pleasant staying experience. But it get little short in term of service for the category of hotel is. It is short in a sense of lack of proactive readiness in the chaotic context.One observation for those are sensible to the water, shampoo etc provided in hotels feels better quality than average; coming from a person sensible to these, the water was softer than expected, feel ""not hardness"" of the water. Compared to Hyatt (cat 4) as I often frequent, their water does not give same effect. "
"We've stayed at this hotel a few times in the past when it was part of the Mandarin Oriental chain of hotels. I was worried when we booked again with the change to Loews as to what changes we might find. However as soon as we pulled in all worries melted away. We had the same great familiar faces there and ready to greet us. It was wonderful! The staff or each person at the hotel are so helpful and friendly. Everyone seems to know your name.The hotel still offers a wonderful car service and we used it to get to our dinner reservations. The rooms are just a great as ever.The best news! The price that they are booking the rooms for is extremely attractive, especially in comparison to the fees that the Mandarin had been charging. It may not last though so I would check it out if you can."
"We stayed at the Loews Regency for our 10th anniversary trip and it was absolutely amazing. The employees were all great, concierge was amazing, and the drivers in the morning and evening were over the top as well. We upgraded to a room with a bay view and it was well worth it. The views of the bay and city were outstanding. The room was spacious, bed was just what we needed after a day of seeing the city, and everything was very close. When traveling to San Francisco you should stay at the Loews Regency. "
"This was my favorite SF hotel when it was the Mandarin and I looked forward to staying there as I generally enjoy Loews hotels. They have not changed very much of the hotel as they told me that the rooms had been updated 3 years ago. Nevertheless, the hotel felt different. The breakfast was fairly standard fare but quite expensive and Silks no longer exists. Everyone was attentive but it just was not as welcoming as the Fairmont where I had previously stayed. The dark lobby/entry needs to be brightened up."
"Enjoyed our stay at the Loews. Our room on the 45th floor had a beautiful view of the San Francisco Bay with panoramic of the Transamerica building, Coit tower, and the Golden Gate Bridge. The room was spacious but there were some small things that kept it from being great. There was surprisingly little space to unpack with 4 very small drawers in the closet. We were staying for 5 days and that is not adequate space for 2 adults. We would have also appreciated a coffee pot in the room. Room service needs improvement. With a hotel of this caliber (5 star) we were surprised at the very average quality of the food. In room dining is in need of a serious upgrade on basic dishes and this is an area where the hotel needs to improve their product. That being said, the staff is top notch. They were friendly and helpful in every way from the front desk to the doorman to the valet."
"Outstanding hotel.... From the guy who parked our car.... To everyone we had interaction with. We stayed on top the floor(48 th) The view-from of the Bay Bridge was fantastic. This truly is a beautiful way to see the the city. The front desk staff took great care and just were really nice and welcoming people. We will definitely go back and stay again,"
"The room was more spacious than I expected and included a refrigerator, but no in room coffee pot. (I've also stayed at Loews Coronado Bay Resort which has in room Keurig machines but no refrigerators). The Service was great. Lee-Yee helped book my reservation and Bree was very friendly and accommodating with my additional requests. Bree even remembered my name the next day! I meet Chef Ruby who gave me a tour of the kitchens - which are extremely organized and some of the cleanest hotel kitchens I have ever seen. Good job to the culinary team. All the doormen were very attentive and friendly (I am really sad I did not get any of their names in my hurry, but the entire team during my stay 7/22-24 deserve recognition). We valet parked our car and did not have to wait long on either end of the drop off or pick up). Room service was prompted each morning and the coffee was nice and hot. Both our attendants each day (Karla on Saturday and Anthony on Sunday) offered to pour, but I declined in order to keep the coffee hot until I was ready. Housekeeping organized our toiletries in the bathroom when they came to clean, which I thought was a sweet touch. Overall if was a very nice stay. I was here just for the weekend to visit a friend and enjoy all the food the city has to offer, but I can see the appeal of staying here for business."
"My husband and I had a three night stay at Loews in mid April. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we experienced exceptional service. As other guests before us have commented we were always greeted warmly and by name. The staff at the front counter showed genuine interest and helped to ensure that our stay was the best it could possibly be and it was. The check in staff, doorman, concierge, driver and server at breakfast were fantastic and all deserve 5 stars. I celebrated my birthday while at the hotel and the champagne and choc dipped strawberry birthday platter in our suite was a special touch. The room was clean, comfortable with amazing views and we appreciated the turn down service with complementary water and chocolates. It was a prime location and an easy walk to shops, restaurants, bars and key tourist attractions. We were so impressed with Loews that we would highly recommend it to others and are returning for another stay in August. Our sincere thanks to all at Loews we look forward to our next stay in a few weeks, Rod & Monique "
"Remarkably good rate through AMEX, with $100 food credit, free breakfast and upgrade. Ended up on the 45th floor facing both the bridges - dual aspect. Wet bar was great, sheets and towels we perfect, reasonable plug positions for power and computers, deep tub and separate shower, reasonably large room service menu with tasty food, exceptionally good service (Sandy at the front desk was particularly good, as were the door staff). We are a Four Seasons, St Regis, Ritz Carlton etc., family, but we are going to start looking at Loews again. The Santa Monica Loews has never impressed (after four visits) but the SF property is absolutely a five star property at a lower price than many other 'big name' hotel chains. You might end up somewhere else, but please do look at Loews before you book."
"Very luxurious and at the top of a great building, so you have beautiful views and really feel like you are on top of the world. I was able to easily get to the waterfront and to Union Square, so there was plenty to do nearby."
"Perfect from check in to check out. Thank you to Chris at reception for making us feel immediately welcome and doormen Michael, Maurio and the wonderful Eduardo (who is the loveliest man - how he remembers everyone's name is beyond me). Staff offer such personalised service that they manage to create a 'boutique' experience in a large, luxury hotel. Do not hesitate to book the 'Bridge to Bridge' room. Definitely worth paying a bit extra. The room, view, amenities and cleanliness all fantastic. In room dining was exceptional and definitely exceeded our expectations. Best views in San Francisco from the comfort of your room! Housekeeping outstanding, room always spotlessly clean and amenities restocked. Turndown, chocolates and complimentary water a nice touch. Use of house car is a great bonus - drivers were friendly, professional and very knowledgable re the Bay Area. Perfect location, close to everything and safe. I couldn't recommend this hotel more highly and would definitely stay here again. Oh - one more thing, the bed is unbelievably comfortable with the most beautiful, soft linens."
Good location nice room wonderful views but bed small for two people. Silly size of cotton balls when eventually got them opened! What's that about?!?! Concierge Brian really helpful gave us some really good restaurant recommends. All staff pleasant and helpful.Will definately use Leows again.
"This hotel is very nice, well located and with many activities around. The personnel is very nice and we have a great time. Rooms are very comfortable so I was able to relax and enjoy the bed time... It was a pity I couldn't join the spa, next time !"
"I've been to this property before when it was a Mandarin Oriental and let me tell you, though the management has changed, the service and amenities of a five star hotel still remain. Originally I booked a bridge to bridge bay view, but was given the option to upgrade to a suite. I opted for the suite for more space and I couldn't have been happier. Though the room was gorgeous and had a comfortable bed and linens, it was really the view that was the highlight. I have to say that the views at the Lowes Regency are some of the best in the world. I would definitely splurge on a bay view room to make your stay even more special."
"I had a great deal of trepidation about going to the Loews San Francisco after the Mandarin was bought out by that company, a move that we greeted with dismay!. However, after a dismal one night stay in the San Francisco Ritz, I packed up my considerable baggage and moved up into a place high in the sky. All the lovely former Mandarin hotel staff were there and were delighted to see me, recognizing first me and then my child by name and past experiences. The Mandarin was renovated in 2012 and the Loews didn't mess with any of that,so the whole experience is basically intact, just with a different logo (as my 10 year old pointed out!0 - I can't recommend this property highly enough. I've already recommended it to friends and intend to stay there again when we return in a few months. Additionally, when I spoke to our travel agent about switching to the Loews, he, knowing our propensity for 5 star hotels and excellent service, reassured me that the Loews Hotel brand is trying to upgrade its ' hotel all round, and that he had met and thought highly of their executive staff. I'll be staying at the Philadelphia Loews shortly as a result."
"Located high in the financial district, very convent for business with astounding views on a clear day ( yes, there are such days but generally not in July or August)of the city and the bay. Friendly and helpful service but surprisingly mediocre food. Forget the car use Bart which has a stop nearby or Uber which started in San Francisco. "
"The staff and their service was amazing. We were upgraded to the 48th (top) floor which had great views of SF. During our stay 1 of the 2 elevators was broken which caused long wait times (at least 10 minutes). The parking situation is also a bit confusing...only valet parking is available but the front entrance is 1) difficult to find 2) incredibly small! We had to circle twice before we realized where the hotel was and then had to pull ahead and wait with our blinkers on. Concierge and valet were friendly and quick which we appreciated greatly. Overall, a comfortable stay :)"
"We enjoyed our stay at the Loews. Everyone was exceptionally helpful. Michael, the concierge, helped us get tickets to Alcatraz (AmEx Platinum Travel Concierge tried and failed) and quick seating at Tadich Grille, which doesn't accept reservations. The food was tasty and service good. The complementary wine reception at the lookout terrace on the 40th floor was a nice treat. Our only problem was that only one elevator worked, so getting to and from room was time-consuming. Overall, a great experience."
"My wife and I decided to stay at the Loews Regency San Francisco for our first anniversary. We had planned to splurge, but stay around the $600 range. We used booking.com to book the hotel and in the comments, I mentioned that it was our anniversary.The hotel surprised us with a free upgrade to their Deluxe room on the 46th floor with a breathtaking bay view. Absolutely gorgeous. Additionally, we went out for the day and when we returned, there were ""Happy Anniversary"" chocolates and champagne waiting for us.I brought my laptop so my wife and I could watch some wedding videos that I had, but I didn't bring an HDMI cable since most hotels we've gone to are not very convenient when it comes to jacking into the TV. When I saw that the TV had an HDMI input option, I called the concierge to ask if they had a spare cable. They sent their Senior Engineer up with a cable for us.The staff were all super friendly, always using our names and wishing us a Happy Anniversary. It was seriously the 5-star experience that we wished we had during our honeymoon. Additionally, the location of the hotel is super convenient. Only a few blocks from both the Embarcadero and Market street, it is really easy to get around North East San Francisco from the hotel. It was a short walk to Powell to take the cable cars, and the F line was an easily accessible cheap form of transportation to the piers and back. The hotel also offered a car service to locations that are ""within range"" which included our dinner reservation in North Beach. If you plan on spending your time in northern San Francisco, this is a really well located hotel. So glad we decided to stay at this hotel for our anniversary."
"From the minute we needed directions to refuel the hire car the people at the hotel could not do enough for us. The service was simply outstanding. They helped with recommendations for restaurants....they actually booked tables for us, we were invited to wine evenings on the terrace and sent complimentary Champagne for our wedding anniversary. The hotel is located in a decent and central area and as I say the staff were brilliant. Thank you for making our stay such a good one Loews."
Beds are wonderful here! Located within walking distance of lots of stuff. Room service was quick. We had breakfast both days here and it was a nice presentation. Food was good. Staff called us by name and met our every need. View is incredible and they provide binoculars. There is no air conditioning in the room - only heat. We did get hot and having the windows open didn't cool the room very well. Fans would be helpful to circulate the air. 
"We stayed in room 4505, which overlooks the entire bay. The room was excellent and all the amenities were great. We would have had a great view of the fireworks show had it not fog, but what can you do about that. We ate the Fog Harbor and had a great dinner, "
"I do not love heights. The rooms start on the 38th floor and although the view was spectacular from our 43rd floor room, I personally felt much better with the curtains closed. The room was comfortable and luxurious. If you love high up arial views you will love it. They even supplied binoculars in the room."
"I was very pleasantly surprised to walk into my room at the Loew's Regency and be surrounded by plush accommodations and fantastic views of San Francisco. Staff were friendly and attentive and my stay, although only one night, was very comfortable"
"We booked two rooms here, one for our daughter, and one for my wife and me. The rooms were lovely, comfortable, and very clean. We were on the 44th floor with incredible views. The hotel provided excellent service, especially Bree at the front desk. We attended a wine/champagne reception on the 40th floor outside decks, which was a real treat. The hotel is nicely located so guests can head out in any number of directions to see the city. We wish we could have stayed a few more days."
The hotel's location is great and quite centre. Minutes walking distance away from shopping area and the pier. We stayed in the room that has views of both Bay Bridge and Golden Gate bridge. The view from the room is fantastic.The staff are helpful. We arrived late and wanted to have a quick dinner in the restaurant. We called and the kitchen waited for us though we passed the last order time. The food is amazing and we had the best pasta we've ever had. The valet and doorman are extremely kind and offered great service.We shall return for sure when we visit SF in the future!
This hotel was great!! it had great views and everyone was so helpful and nice.If you have a chance to stay here you should!! they have a hotel car that will take you around town and will get you dinner reservations anywhere you like.
"The hotel room is wonderful. although a bit dated it was well worth the price paid and the views were second to none. We enjoyed are 40th floor room and the views of the bay. large open bathroom with floor to ceiling windows. Bath time was a serious delight for my wife. There was a car service to be used from the hotel to anywhere in the city. The staff was very knowledgable, kind and courteous. We will be staying here for the weekend again even though we are locals just 35 miles south."
"Stayed here for a couple of days in June. Arrival was good with quick luggage and car handling. Check-in was good, room ready at noon. They did omit covering the Amex Fine Hotel benefits completely and I had to return later to ask another receptionist to explain the benefits. Room here always have great city/bay/bridge views and are some of the best in the city.We used the concierge service and received quick/helpful suggestions. We were offered the hotel car service each evening and this was a convenient way to travel to/from restaurants without having to worry about finding a taxi.Enjoyed the small restaurant for breakfast and evening drinks/appetizers and the waiters/bartender were excellent!Overall, we enjoyed our stay here. We had stayed here many times when the hotel was a Mandarin Oriental Hotel and were unsure how we would feel with new ownership, but the staff was familiar and service was still top notch. Thanks for a great stay."
"this hotel has set the bar, and it's a high bar. highly recommended!!!!! we reserved a partial bay view. the room (on the 48th floor) was spectacular. it had views of the bay bridge and Alcatraz. there was even a skinny window in the bathroom, so you have a view while on the toilet. had to be mindful to close the blinds at times though! the bellman (i believe his name was Michael) was fantastic. he explained so much to us, from hotel services to the city. the hotel offered a nightly car service (reserve early). we rode in Cadillac and Mercedes. both drivers were professional and courteous. during the day there were a few taxis outside, but Uber was half the price with nicer cars. (UberJay was the best!!) there is also a BART station a few blocks away. it was easy to catch a train to the Warriors game. we were celebrating a birthday and was surprised with a bottle of FIJI water and chocolate truffles. it was a deliciously unexpected surprise! again, just above and beyond any other hotel i've stayed in. the free bottles of water at turndown were fabulous. this was one of the reasons we selected the hotel, and it far exceeded free water. other services included an umbrella during the rainy days, free package delivery to our room, champagne while waiting for the car service. they also knew and mentioned us by name each time we left and returned. we felt extremely welcome, like family. there was a DVD player in the room, but they did not have DVDs to checkout. a Redbox was a quick walk, and far cheaper than the on-demand movies. the only thing i was not a fan of was room service. i didn't find the food to be that high quality."
"Everything about the hotel was wonderful. The staff were incredibly helpful, the rooms were very nice and extremely clean and the bed was SO comfortable. We would absolutely stay here again! We had amazing reviews from all 3 rooms we had booked. And we even enjoyed the complimentary champagne and wine on the deck at 5pm."
"In the heart of it all....... The staff was incredible, and the room was amazing! Spacious, comfortable, well designed, and the bedding couldn't have been better. From the moment we arrived till the moment we left it was above and beyond all expectations. "
"Excellent hotel in a good location, within walking distance to Fishermans Wharf. We chose a bridge to bridge room with a great view of both bridges and Alcatraz. The service was superb and a special mention for Anton behind the bar who made sure there was always a cold beer to hand. Breakfast on the last day was probably the best I have ever tasted in any hotel."
"My stay at Loews Regency was great. The hotel's location was very central and offered great services. The staff was always very helpful and attentive. The rooms were spacious, very clean, and a great view. The food at the restaurant was delicious and the service was wonderful. I highly recommend to stay at this hotel when visiting San Francisco. "
Staff remains attentive and focused on making the guest experience very good. Happy that many of the team from prior management company transitioned to Leows. Lots of nearby restaurants to enjoy. Venture out and ask Concierge team for places that meet your preferences.
"We celebrated our anniversary at the Loews Regency because we honeymooned in San Francisco 30 years ago. Even before we arrived, the Loews Regency showed what kind of stay it was going to be. I emailed the hotel and received a timely and friendly response.Then, when we arrived, Bree checked us in. Our flight had been delayed and we were a bit frayed. She offered us a complimentary bottle of water, took care of holding our bags, recommended a restaurant, provided a map and even drew on the map her directions. She was so nice and went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. (We even went back to ask her name because I wanted to acknowledge her in this review.)After we checked in, a bottle of champagne and a tray of chocolate covered strawberries arrived, compliments of the management. With it was a lovely note congratulating us on our special occasion. While the complimentary wine and strawberries were fabulous, the note really touched me. Such a lovely and personal touch. We don't routinely stay at properties of this level, so we mistakenly left the ""do not disturb"" sign on the door and missed the turndown service. We only knew this because they left a note! We stepped out to run a couple of quick errands, and when we returned, they had come in and done the turndown! They even folded a pair of yoga pants I had left on the sofa! I could go on and on, but I know most people don't read long reviews. The view was amazing. Every employee -- and I mean every employee -- always had a friendly hello. The room was luxurious and the bed was terrific. I loved the amenities. The only thing I would warn people about is the neighborhood. It's close to everything and convenient to all forms of public transit, but it is a business district. Everything shuts down at 5:00 PM, so if you want nearby bars, restaurants, etc. you won't find them on your doorstep. We loved, loved, loved this hotel and would stay here again anytime. "
We stayed over memorial weekend at Loews Regency in San Francisco and it was a great experience. The staff made this a 5 star stay! The location of the hotel was perfect and our 2 windows in our deluxe king room looked out to the Bay Bridge on one side Golden age Bridge on the other and Alcatraz in the middle . Needless to say the views were spectacular! I would recommend this hotel and will be coming back. 
We arrived late at the hotel but was met with a very friendly staff. We were booked on the 47th floor and what a breathtaking view of the city. The room overlooked the bay and bridge. It was an oversized room The shower in this bathroom was amazing. I believe my husband took 2 showers a day. Close to all the tour destinations. We are looking forward to coming back and visiting this hotel.
"My family and I stayed for Memorial day Weekend and it was great. The staff was attentive and very professional. The rooms were cozy and spacious and had a great view of the city. Even the gym was fully equipped with a variety of machines, accessories, water bottles and complimentary headphones. The food was delicious at the restaurant and even the room service was quick. Would definitely recommend to stay here and look forward to returning."
