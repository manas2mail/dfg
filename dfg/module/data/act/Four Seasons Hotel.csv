Review
"This was my third stay at this property. The first two were great. The most recent stay, I really enjoyed the newly renovated rooms and had a great sleep. That being said, I noticed the service during check-in and the service in general at the property was not at the level it had been previously. That being said, the sleep made up for it and I would likely come back."
"The past couple of Four Seasons I have stayed in in cities have left me unimpressed, but the San Francisco hotel was definitely a marked improvement. The location is convenient and the common spaces are lovely. The room was comfortable, as usual... I was particulary happy to discover the cozy window seat, which was a great place to sit with a glass of wine at the end of a long day. The service was impeccable and friendly. We had two adjoining rooms with our teenagers, which was the perfect arrangement. We did not get a chance to visit the restaurant, but the kids did enjoy their room service dinners the one time they ordered. I would stay again and recommend this hotel to others traveling for business or pleasure."
The bedroom is quite nice for $472 per night. The hotel is in the center of town 3 blocks from the conference center My wife and I enjoyed staying thereReceiving a text message welcoming us was a nice touchGreat place to stay
"Stayed for several days with family. Staff was very courteous and helpful -- from the front desk to the doormen and bell staff to the waitstaff in the restaurants. The decor, however, is a bit boring and antiseptic -- it has the feel of office decor. Not luxurious, not charming. Cold and business-like. Lobby and bar unremarkable. Our room, the same. Makes you feel like Four Seasons is going the way of other former luxurious hotels, which are succumbing to the dynamics of belonging to large hotel chains, like the Ritz. If you've visited the one in Naples, FL, you get the feeling that it is more akin to a high end Holiday Inn. Everything is cookie-cutter. Doesn't feel special.So in the end, you don't feel it's worth the price."
"Traveling for business, stay at the Four Seasons on Market St. The space itself if both perfectly curated while still warm and invitng. Partnered with Equinox gym you have the best of both worlds from luxury hotel and full fledge sports club. Take a break from your meetings and get your sweat on. Then hit the spa for an amazing massage (you've earned it). End your day with an amazing hand crafted cocktail before digging into some amazing food. Service is prefect and the people watching is not to bad either!"
This hotel is amazing!Great location a beautiful view on Market St and Grand where you can see the entrance at the Chinese town.Very clean and a wonderful smell every where in the hotel.Great Servece from all the people who work in the hotel.Is a fantastic weekend at San Francisco Ca and our staying at the wonderful Four Season Hotel.Thank you!
"At their resort properties, Four Seasons really delivers. At the beach, on the slopes, or in even more exotic locales, the brand is synonymous with a luxurious experience in beautiful settings. When it comes to its city locations, where there are so many other options, I think they need to work harder to stand above the rest. And I didn't see much evidence of that during our stay at the San Francisco hotel.There were some good things: the lobby decor is pleasing and our room -- one of the newly refurbished ones -- was quite nice. Nothing about the furnishings were statement-making, but it was comfortable and felt high end. We went to the restaurant each day of our stay and liked it. And as Equinox members, it was great to have a club right downstairs.I was not impressed, however, by the clerk who checked us in, nor by the concierge. I'd describe their approach as workmanlike as opposed to representing the best of the best when it comes to hotel service. The front desk clerk seemed miffed when I interrupted his spiel by asking a question about the Equinox facilities (""I was just getting to that."") Later in our stay, when I approached the concierge desk, that gentleman merely looked up and stared at me blankly until I spoke (no ""may I help you?""). In a bustling mid-tier hotel, I would not give these things a second thought. But our experiences do not sync with the Four Seasons reputation, or the Four Seasons prices. I wouldn't stay here again... there are too many other options in SF that offer elevated surroundings with service to match."
"Charmed by the very comfortable window seat with a window that actually opens. Everything is well-appointed, thought-out, comfortable. Top of the line gym facilities, with a pool. Huge, extremely comfortable bed with top drawer linens. Great tub. Get a beverage at the bar and enjoy the veranda that overlooks the CJM. "
"We came to FS San Francisco to celebrate our 18th wedding anniversary. We planned a day in the city and a day in wine country and lots of relaxing at this beautiful hotel. The service, the quality, and the views from our gorgeous corner room were lovely and comfortable. We loved every second we spend in the room and in the hotel itself. However, we will not return as the minute we would step outside to explore the city, we felt immediately unsafe, uncomfortable, and very stressed out. While waiting for a train to the waterfront less than one block away from the property, we were nearly mugged. Shame on us for looking like “tourists” but regardless, for staying at such a high end hotel, we expected to be able to enjoy the block or so around the hotel safely and happily as tourists and visitors. We ended up aborting waiting for the train to escape in a cab. Shaken and a little traumatized, we tried to calm down in the cab. The driver warned us that the area that we were staying at was apparently notorious for dangerous pick pockets who target people just like us, tourists. For the rest of the trip, we avoided leaving the hotel and this didn’t get to enjoy half of what we hopped to explore. We left bummed out and grateful that our experience wasn’t worse. And we vowed never to stay in the city again. Sorry, San Francisco. "
"Living in Asia and a frequent traveller staying at 5 star hotels, I have learnt to limit my expectations in N. America with a handful of exceptions. This Four Seasons is definitely one of those exceptions. From the professional and helpful Check-In by Jose to the excellent In-Room dining by Katherine, ably supported by a very high standard of Housekeeping. Cheerful, enthusiastic staff ably led by GM Doug Housely. I was lucky to be the first occupant of a newly renovated suite 1001 which is well worth the premium with a more than adequate living room and good size bedroom. The property is right in the heart of the business district only a short stroll to Union Square. Excellent Concierge team as well. I recommend it without hesitation and will be back."
"The Four Seasons SF is a spectacular hotel in San Francisco. Great location, wonderful rooms and amenities. I would highly recommend, The property has gone through a renovation and the rooms are great, food is always delicious and the atmosphere is fun!"
"Reasons why I do not recommend this hotel1.hotel not as appealing as described, dreariness ambiance2.My junior suite had an unobstructed view of a roof and I requested room change , to no avail.3.Bathrobe were so old that have holes in several places , I returned them to front desk manager4.Towels were old and worn off, perfect to dry your car but not for personal use.5.Room was dated and run down, no luxury accommodations as advertised6. The only restaurant has very limited options on menu, and service and food were below average.7. Service at hotel bar was extremely poor, wait was long, drinks delivered were the wrong one and the waiter lacked appropriate customer service skills.FOUR SEASONS SAN FRANCISCO DOES NOT MEASURE UP TO THE CHAIN'S STANDARDS AND DOES NOT HOLD UP TO THE EXTREMELY HIGH CRITERIA OF THE VIRTUOSO CHAIN. HOTEL FAILED TO FULFILL EVEN THE BASICS!!!"
"The staff at the Four Seasons San Francisco were considerate and professional. Great attention to detail is very welcomed. The hotel is conveniently located. I would return to the hotel, the next I am in the area to stay."
"Would definitely stay here again. Not sure it's totally worth price, but very nice, comfortable and clean. Good service as well. Didn't love having to take 2 sets of elevators but obviously way worse things in life. "
"Biggest complaint was that as a guest, I have to fight my way through the lobby which appears utilized by non guests and business meetings starting at 6 am! I even have to struggle to get coffee from the bar as the whole area is monopolized by people having business meetings (almost all are not guests of the hotel). The best part of the hotel is the housekeeping, who were suberb every day."
"We love the gym, saunas, the thoughtful service and close proximity to the moscone center and shopping. The housekeeping staff do a great job making you feel special. We try to stay here every year we visit. This is a fantastic property and is well managed. "
"A great hotel both for business and leisure. Discrete, smart, personalised service in a modern elegant setting with easy access to incredible sports facilities. Absolutely the place to be during conference week at JP Morgan Healthcare with great vibes and ambience ; at other times, just a wonderful smart setting with personalised discrete service "
I was greeted by Mr. ___ the entire time. IMPRESSIVE! Everyone was so friendly. Room was modern and up to date. Room service was prompt and delicious. The valet stand was super quick too. Will be back for my next trip to SFO. 
"It was our second time staying at this hotel. It was such a wonderful experience. The room was beautiful and the bed/ linens divine. The whole stay was lovely. Sometimes staying in San Franciscocan be very frenetic but staying at the Four Seasons is very restful, calm and relaxing. My favorite hotel in the city!"
"The Four Seasons San Francisco was built before its time ... but today is in the heart of San Francisco - blocks from Union Square, The Ferry Terminal, and the booming vibrant area of SOMA. With the or recent renovation of the lobby bar - it is one of The happening cocktail hour bars. The staff are well trained and attentive and the rooms were are comfortable with all of the technology you should expect in a modern luxury hotel."
"My entire stay was exceptional from start to finish. The staff was extremely helpful, thoughtful and polite. This is important to note because the hotel was at full capacity during the busiest week of the year in San Francisco. Nothing fell through the cracks. It was exactly the experience that the Four Seasons brand always delivers."
We have just stayed 2 nights at the Four Seasons San Francisco.The Hotel is centrally located near Union Square and major shopping precinct.The rooms are well furnished and appointed.Service is great-we had an issue with our TV but it was resolved within 10 minutes of calling housekeeping.We also liked the MKT Restaurant for breakfast-suggest the San Francisco omelet with a side dish of turkey bacon.
"My husband and I usually stay at Four Seasons Properties during vacations. I was very disappointed with our stay. The hotel lacked the usual Four Seasons hospitality that makes this chain so special and worth the cost. We had a problem with our room, and when we called housekeeping they didn't go our of their way to immediately fix the situation. During check out when I raised the issue, there was no attempt to better understand the situation. Only after raising the issue head office was the situation given the proper attention. There were many wonderful parts of our stay. The location of the property is excellent, footsteps to transit and many attractions. The gym is really well appointed! We were celebrating our anniversary and the hotel treated us to a bottle of brut and chocolate covered strawberries. Our room was also upgraded to a lovely suite. I love San Francisco and we will be back but not to this hotel."
"I was so surprised and disappointed by my stay. If I had been blindfolded and put inside the room and then took the blindfold off and had to guess which hotel I was in, I would have guessed a nice Sheraton or a Westin.The rooms are clean but bland and unremarkable. There is just nothing special about place, including the drab lobby. The problem is that this hotel costs three times what a Westin costs. So for that I cannot recommend it at all."
"I loved this hotel - it's a bit hard to find if you are going to valet park on a one-way busy street with a small pull-in off an alleyway - but the FS app address brought me right to it on google maps. As always, I was promptly spoiled from greeting to departure. The valet staff are always excellent at the FS and they took care of my bags and car while I went inside to check in. I was provided an upgrade for my birthday and when I arrived in my beautiful corner suite there was a birthday cake and card from my travel agent and hotel manager waiting for me with some other sweets and snacks. Nailed it. The bar downstairs is very nice with a chevron-brick fireplace and they had sweet tea (thank you from the bottom of the Southern heart). I had dinner in the attached restaurant and was less than pleased with the portion sizes and prices but that's another review. I had room service for dinner and ordered breakfast in the room both dates with smoothies and other healthy options - I'm always pretty happy with the menu in the FS hotels for someone who is health-conscious and concerned with their diet and veggie intake. The location is fabulous - from the resident entrance side there are tons of upscale shops and you can easily walk the downtown to the trolly lines and buses. Lots of stuff is nearby and tons and tons of places to eat. Valet is something like $60-70 a night - so be prepared for that sticker shock - but otherwise - gorgeous and I was spoiled the entire time. "
"Excellent experience through the years that we've stayed at this place ""where everybody knows your name"". This place I call "" my home""Front desk service is par excellence- to name a few Natalie, Chad, Kate Russel .Jovi (head of housekeeping)- thanks for paying attention to details."
Beautiful hotel with an amazing staff. Bed is like sleeping on air. Shower is wonderful. Hotel is centrally located to everything great in San Francisco. We will most certainly return to the city and this property.
"Starting with the fitness center which is huge and has every conceivable piece of gym equipment we loved our stay at this Four Seasons. Vanessa, the concierge we worked with did a masterful job. We didn't like the first suite we were taken to and when the fellow who brought our luggage up heard he got on the phone to the front desk and arranged for a change to a lovely suite with a much better view. We used the hotel car every evening for dinner. Loved the bar. The hotel is in the process of renovating some rooms. Ours was just completed so everything was new. The hotel is perfectly located. Close to everything we did. Will certainly stay again when we return to SF."
"Awful service and staff. Was treated very poorly and made to stay on the phone with Amex for 30 minutes in front of the front desk to get some code that wasn’t really necessary. And when i did but didn’t have my Amex card on me, they didn’t honor my upgrades and discounts. They easily could have but chose not to just to be difficult. Never going there again. "
I have stayed her twice. Once with daughter during holiday season and once with husband for wedding anniversary. Both times with southern facing room and view of the SFBay. Wonderful food! Comfortable bed! Excellent spot to recharge. Definitely my favorite SF hotel.
"Be prepared for a fantastic experience. Best location in the city. Central to everything. Have stayed here twice this quarter end. Would recommend this hotel to travelers weather solo, couples or families."
"I’ve stayed here before but it’s been a few years. The location is perfect. Next to the mall, union square, unlimited amount of restaurants and bars. But they need to have a better in house restaurant with a deeper menu. It felt like ordering from a chili’s inside the airport. The room service messed up my order so I walked downstairs in the cold and walked next door to a cafe for a breakfast sandwich. I happened to stay there while there was a City plumbing issue that required the entire hotels water supply be turned off from 1am to 5am and I just got home from a bar at 1am and couldn’t take a shower or use the toilet. I’m just irritated that overall the hotel wasn’t in the condition I’m used to see a Four Seasons be in. And I also wasn’t informed of the issues before booking my stay "
"This hotel was beyond incredible from check-in to check-out. When I got to the front desk, I realized I didn't have my wallet and that I must have left it in the cab. the desk agent told me not to worry and checked me in. They didn't ask for any information yet 30 minutes later, someone was at my door with my wallet on a literal serving platter. They had watched the security footage to see what cab I got out of, contacted the company, and met the driver to retrieve my wallet. In addition to the service, the room was also impeccable. The bed was comfortable, the mini bar was stocked with everything a person could need, and the room was huge for San Francisco."
Lovely stay. Super comfortable beds. Great service. Work party which was beautifully done. Very tasteful all around.Expected higher quality bath products (L’Occotaine provided) for this level of hotel. Great bar.
"The room is very clean and soundproof. They have super friendly staff and very good housekeeping service. The location is good as well: five minutes walk to Westfield and Union Square area. Btw, the Christmas decor is amazing."
"Great location to be at in San Fransisco! Your in the middle of everything! Great food & shopping galore....there’s even a Museum of Ice cream across the street! Great bloody Mary’s at the Mkt bar inside the hotel, too."
"There is a reason we always stay at the Four Seasons San Francisco- From the moment you arrive you are treated so special! We returned for another wonderful 6 nights and our visit was MAGNIFICENT!All of the staff take so much pride in making their guests happy! Their passion and dedication is what we love about this hotel.We were checked in quickly by Nana at the Front Desk. Thanks to Bing and Rory for handling our luggage.The concierge desk is so helpful and always there to help with sightseeing suggestions, restaurant reservations etc. - Barbara was so lovely and even wrote us a beautiful note when we left the hotel.All the doormen are the BEST! Always so helpful and with the BEST ATTITUDE!We had breakfast every morning at the MKT Restaurant at the hotel. It is a beautiful environment with the most AMAZING staff! All the staff greeted us and remembered us from our last visit. What a great feeling to hear ""Welcome Back!” Thank you to everyone there including Mikko, Joel, Jie, Angel, Sean, Marcos, Leanne and Evelyn. The service is excellent! The breakfast food is delicious with many offerings. You will have the BEST breakfast at MKT! Thank you also to Natalie the hostess and Anna the Assistant Restaurant Manager for being so attentive to us every morning! There is a reason a restaurant runs so smoothly – thanks to Brad the Restaurant Manager and Alex –Assistant Food and Beverage Manager. We were there during Thanksgiving and returned again with our family for their magnificent Thanksgiving dinner the restaurant offers. It was truly exceptional! Thank you to Karen for providing us with great service that day.The MKT Bar is great for drinks and you can also have lunch and dinner there too! We ate there one evening and Christian provided us with great service! The Bar is the place to be at night! We had a corner room with wonderful views! The rooms are spacious with the finest bedding, large bathrooms and all the luxury you would expect in a 5 star hotel! The housekeeping staff was so accommodating to every request we had.Thank you Chiko for always making us feel like royalty! You are such an incredible person!Why do we keep returning to the Four Seasons San Francisco? PERFECTION, EXCELLENT SERVICE, FABULOUS FOOD, WONDERFUL ACCOMODATIONS and the most AMAZING STAFF! There is a reason the hotel has 5 stars from Forbes- which is the hotel industry’s highest rating. If you are looking for the FINEST 5 STAR hotel in San Francisco- there is only one choice- The Four Seasons San Francisco!"
"We stayed in this property when it first opened years ago , we liked the location , convenience , and the decor , however we did not like the LA fitness ( now Equinox ) managed heath club , the exercise area we do not mind sharing with many people , but the pool was the problem. , always crowded and need to share lanes with many , not desiarable for a first class hotel We moved to St Regis close by ( room not as good ) but pool is rarely busy and open 24 hrs for the last 10 plus years when we visited SF . We are back this time for 2 days. , the hotel also is the condo for private residence in the higher floor ( hotel guest the lower floors ) , the doorman , receptionist all friendly and helpful. One bed room suit is very nice , roomy comfort. , on ten floor , not much of a view . The bell captain super helpful , bought us extra bottle of water and ice The pool was closed for duration of our stay ( may be a blessing !) My wife set up a massage. , very accommodating There is a bar at the lobby level , very busy in the evening , the hotel MTK restaurent is good but not refined ( for , breakfast , lunch and dinner ) . We like the room and space here , may be the best in town ( we have stayed in all the best hotels here ) , May be the hotel Can set up with the private Health club special reserved swim lanes for other perks for the guest. ( then I will give a five star )"
"Our recent stay left a lot to be desired. We chose the Four Seasons San Francisco to celebrate our honeymoon based on the unforgettable stays we have experienced at other locations (London, Seattle). Sadly, this property didn't seem to live up to the same standard. One key thing that sticks in our mind was our need to have to request our room to be serviced (was not done automatically during the day). Also, our check-in was rather impersonal and rushed. A note had been made upon our reservation to indicate our special celebration; however, that too seemed to get lost in the shuffle. At the same time, our arrival was significantly delayed due to airline issues. This caused us to arrive extremely late (3am). There were no attempts to help us adjust and get comfortable."
"From the moment we were welcomed at the valet parking, through check in, service during the Christmas party, until we left the next day, the staff made every effort to make sure we were treated the way a ""guest"" should be treated at a great hotel. Thank you once again for a memorable event. "
I recently stayed at your San Francisco hotel and when I checked-in I was told my rate was $425 and that I would be staying in a room with two twin beds. Paying $425 for a room with two twin beds seem outrageous.
"This hotel is certainly not on a par with the Four Seasons Brand. Needs updating and renovation to match the standards at other Four Season locations.The Market street entrance is full of homeless, beggars and raving lunatics! Hardly a desirable entrance to the hotel. San Francisco has a MAJOR homeless problem and is unable to control the problem. I would never recommenda downtown hotel experience in this city. "
"The hotel is in a good location~ very convenienct.Stander room with city view, during our stay the house keeping service was wonderful~Besides, we loves the bed in the hotel, we got good sleeps during our stay in SF."
"I previously stayed at a different 5 star hotel in the financial district. The Four Seasons SF will nlw be my hotel in SF. The staff is competent and friendly, and in particular the concierge staff and Vanessa are the can-do concierges that you expect at a top tier 5 star hotel."
A city centre Four Seasons with familiar style and large rooms etc. Service well up to usual 4S standards and an interesting food selection in restaurant and bar.No problems or complaints in any way - but that is what I expect with 4Seasons.
"From the moment we drove up to the Four Seasons, we were in the best care. The facilities, as always were I perfect condition. The gentleman that checked us in was excellent, as were the housekeeping and restaurant members. It could not have been more perfect. Bravo!"
"We stayed for the weekend at this elegant hotel, which is positioned close to great shopping and near Union Square, all within walking distance. There is a great gym and hair salon in the hotel. Beds are super comfy and the bathroom nicely appointed. We loved the views from the 16th floor . Breakfast was over priced but delicious."
"Great location with superb hospitality. The staff goes the extra steps to assure your trip centers around you and your needs. From check in, to dining or room experience, everyone gives you a wonderful travel experience. Close to union square shopping, or downtown financial centers."
"Marvelous rooms with exquiste bathrooms, lots of lighting, nice thick comforters.Everyone at hotel has impeccable work ethic from doormen to housekeeping to breakfast servers.Equinox gym is 5star as well, didnt get to try spa."
"My wife and 4yr old daughter checked in a day after I did. The check in staff made sure they had all of their information to be ready for their arrival and make their check in as smooth as possible. Once they checked in they took some additional details about my family and while they were out exploring we came back to a delivered plate of cookies, milk and a mini robe for my daughter! It was priceless."
"Pros--Room was spacious, immaculate and quiet, as in previous stays. Equinox health club attached to hotel is among best in the US. Excellent location for business and leisure. Breakfast is top notch. Cons--front desk was not as welcoming as in previous stays. Dinner at MKT (hotel restaurant) was spotty as to food quality and does not have a vibe or service comparable to other top SF hotels."
"I'm in San Francisco about once a year and always stay at this property. The staff are very friendly and accommodating, and all of the rooms have great views of the city. I love how quiet and relaxed the public areas are, and I look forward to returning each year."
Whether a staycation vacation or just a out of town weekend get-away do yourself a favor and experience first class accommodations. No reason to stay anywhere else! Best of the Best. Be sure to request corner suite to appreciate the views 
"I thought the service we experienced was excellent, the staff was great! Housekeeping did come to early in the morning to clean the room. The swimming pool was not available during our stay which was a disappointment. "
"The staff is very friendly.I expect a coffee maker in my hotel room, especially if I pay over $500 per night. It is nice to have the option of turning on a machine when you wake up instead of having to dress and go to the lobby for a cup of coffee. Most hotels from Motel 6 to Ritz Carlton offer this amenity. "
Excellent experience on all levels!! This hotel provides quality and comfort and ensures your stay is fantastic and one you would want to repeat. During the conference all the facilities and staff were great! 
It was wonderful staying at the Four Seasons - my first time staying in one of the chain's hotels. I definitely hope to go back to any one of their locations. All the little added touches really make the experience worth while.
"Returned to Four Seasons to stay during Dreamforce, where the city is overtaken by 170,000 convention attendees. While the hotel was full, the bars and lounges were busy, and the restaurants were booked for private events, the hotel staff handled everything with ease.Room was great, very comfortable bed, fully equipped bathroom with a tub and a shower, robe, and good AC/heating controls.Hotel maids are a bit persistent when it comes to afternoon service - they will enter even if you decline to ask several times if you want turndown service.Would definitely stay here again - anytime!"
"There is no other Luxury Hotel except the F.Seasons S.F. To stay. The location is centrally located for shopping, restaurants, or walking to the Pier. The rooms are perfectly appointed. The staff is first class."
We had a lovely stay. Everything was as bit should be in a top class City Hotel. It is well situated for shopping and sightseeing. We had all our meals in the MKT bar where the barmen were so friendly and we met many interesting people. Thank you for making our stay so memorable.
"The bedding, the bathroom, the towels, the service, the lobby bar, and the location. The place is elegant yet not stuffy. I was fortunate to stay there during a major conference and found myself want to skip out on events and get back to the peace and quite of this hotel."
"My husband and I had planned our anniversary trip to Napa, sadly the fires began the day before we were to arrive. since we had our plane tickets we decided to forge ahead and spend our time in San Fran. We had no hotel reservations, no restaurant reservations and frankly were very concerned about those in napa and very down about our celebratory weekend. The Four Seasons turned it around for us. Robbin in reservations helped us secure a room even though it was incredibly busy and Chad checked us in early and secured us a beautiful room and simply couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. The concierge booked us into great restaurants and helped us plan our days and the cherry on top were the breakfasts and dinner we enjoyed at the hotel. I had a facial at the spa and it was one of the best I have ever received...and i am picky! All to say a class act on all fronts. We have recommended it highly to friends, two of which have already made bookings. Keep up the good work San Fran. Four Seasons, we will be back!"
"On Monday October 23, 2017, while staying at the San Francisco Four Season (room #611), I experienced significant construction noise (hammering, drilling, sawing, etc.) in what sounded like the room just below mine from 11PM to about 230AM. At around 1230AM, I called the front desk to complain about the noise. I was informed that construction was taking place in the Equinox sport center inside the hotel and that ""they are not a part of the hotel, so there is very little we can do."" The front desk did say that security would be sent to the Equinox facility to ask them to ""keep it down."" This had zero impact. The noise continued to keep me (and I presume other) awake. I was also told that ""I could move rooms, if I'd like."" This suggestion seemed odd to me. Why was I put in this room, allowed to unpack and go to sleep only to be awoken with construction noise, if the Equinox construction was a known issue? Why was I located in room #611 with construction noise impacts, if another room without the noise issue was available? This was a major fail on the part of the Four Seasons. Very odd and unprofessional. Why not negotiate with Equinox to close for a day or two and do construction during working hours? Or, if that was not possible, why not move all guests away from rooms impacted by the construction noise? Who made these choice to simply ignore reality and do nothing about it? Seems very amateurish and inconsiderate to guests. I was only able to sleep about 2 hours that night, and had a presentation to give at 8AM the next morning. The experience was terrible and not befitting a motel, let alone a hotel with four-star prices. Is this really how the Four Seasons operates? "
"The hotel is perfectly located - Market street is the main city through-passage, close to the fashion stores, historical trams stop and places of interest. Traditionally for Four Seasons, the service is very good; everywhere, from the room service to the reception you meet a true attention and support. I'd like to express my gratitude to the reception and management for a reasonable room upgrade and a realtime notifications about the room availability. Another bonus - you can use a well equipped city gym, which allows the hotel guests to entry. Many thanks for the staff members and management for the nice memories about our stayRoom recommendation: suites with a Market Street view are really cool"
"Four Seasons 5 star service at this property is no different. Front desk is outstanding, room service is great. They truly cater to your specific needs and recognize you. Would highly recommend for business or leisure. "
"Gorgeous hotel and friendly staff. White glove service! Very big beautiful room? Immaculately clean. Great room service and maid service too. All special requests honored. Great location, walking distance to everything. "
This is a great hotel right in the heart of San Francisco. Everything is first rate. You can depend on a pampered stay at the Four Seasons. Room service was timely and the food was excellent. I had an in room massage and it was arranged promptly by the concierge.
"Nice experience in SF. An old fashion’s hotel in a modern building, perfectly located iwith a very very good staff and concierge. quality breakfast but need booking a table Events if you staying in the hotel."
"First all, I have to point out how friendly White Americans are. Not a day goes by without me having a pleasant chat with someone here so I don't want to complain unnecessarily and this has been mostly a lovely experience. I'm on my tech sabbatical and I had a lovely lunch experience at AirBnB HQ so when I was walking down the street I saw a familiar brand and stopped for a sundowner. Overall I've about 2 hours here catching with emails, social media & messages. I was hungry so I ordered a snack but I watched other people being offered popcorn & other snacks. Eventually I ordered a burger then other people sat next to me. The server changed halfway rhrough and maybe I just like to eat but I never got offered the bar snacks until I asked for the popcorn, on principle. San Francisco is a challenging city for Black people. This isn't about color but I ended up ordering 2 meals because I was hungry so I would have liked to be offered exactly the same service as everyone who say down here!"
Ask for a high floor with view to the ocean and wait for the details to help you enjoy your stay.The first impression is not a great one (I don't like to have the reception on the 4th floor) at least not the one you expect from Four Seasons. But during the stay several small details and attentions make you feel good about the hotel.
"Stayed for 1 night with my family and none of us wanted to leave. If you are traveling with kids and expect great service, the Four Seasons never disapoints.The cribs for my kids were the perfect size (sometimes hotel cribs are super tiny) and arrived in my room ready, with a sheet, blanket and toiletries and extra diapers for the kids. You would not believe how many times I have asked for cribs in other ""5 star hotels"" and have gotten just the crib, with no sheets or blanket. One other things that I have noticed in every Four Seasons property I have stayed with toddlers, is that there is always a diaper genie in the bathroom, which I love.Had 2 meals at MKT restaurant with the kids and the staff was very attentive and just super nice to my talkative and tired toddlers. Anna, the hostess at breakfast was the best!Had heard that the rooms were not as special as in other newer properties, and that is true, there isn't an amazing, modern decor, but the rooms were imaculately clean, confortable and with a great view.What has made this my favourite hotel so far in San Francisco is the service. I LOVE it and have recently learned that with or without kids, nothing compares to the Four Seasons! Will come back many times!"
"Stayed 5 nights in room 608. It was literally tiny. For example, there was very little room to move around the bed, and you would have had to be a gymnast to close WC door while in the WC. The room has small, chest-height windows that look onto a rooftop with some mechanical equipment (which has been covered with AstroTurf to make it more aesthetically appealing). This was a 3-star room at best. I am surprised Four Seasons have the nerve to actually sell it."
"Very dated. Surpsingly medicore service. Breakfast was fine, but trying to get a light snack in the bar area was clearly an inconvenience to the staff despite the kitchen still being open. Check-in was poor as they clearly didn’t pay any attention to oir reservation notes. Really questioned, was this a Four Seasons?"
"Great hotel and accommodations. The lobby, bar are all excellent. The Equinox fitness center is in the hotel and a very nice amenity to have access to. The staff attended to details like providing eyeglass cloth for my glasses and neatly tying my electronics cords."
I stayed many times in the Four Seasons San Francisco. It is a superb hotel with fantastic service. I had a problem with my room the first night and half an hour later I was in a new room.The only minor thing is the rooms need a little bit of refreshing (mostly new carpets would be a plus). But it is still a hotel with no major flaws.
"The hotel is excelent, but the TV funtions made the difference. I could watch the movies on my iPad at the TV without cable. That sounds like little, but I loved it. Also, the location is great for the purpose of my trip, and at the heart of the Financial section of the city. Walking distance from Union Square and Moscone Center, and a fast way to get to the Pier zone."
They don't listen to you on whatever circumstances you have. Applying whatever policy they have like your in a court not one of the top hotels chain over the world.They changed me for $1000 for nothing really nothing 
"My preferred hotel in downtown San Francisco, efficient and friendly service, good bar and food, large and nice rooms, excellent bed linen. Right across Powell Station, 5min walk to Union Square, 15min walk to the harbor. Highly recommended"
"I stayed here for JavaOne, so the location was ideal for The Moscone Centre, but it is quite near to Tenderloin, not a great area of San Francisco (if you don't include the bars). The staff were friendly and the hotel has a full health club included in the room. Unfortunately I didn't have time to try the swimming pool. Would stay again on business. I guess the rate wasn't bad for a conference period. My room was facing Market Street, which meant it was a bit noisy early in the morning."
Some friends and I stayed here for two nights after driving up the coast from Los Angeles. The hotel itself is very nice with a very vibrant bar. The staff is amazing and has great suggestions and are very helpful. The problem is that in the downtown area of San Francisco it is rather dirty with a lot of homeless people. If you are going to stay here I would recommend the following:1. Ask for a room on the highest floor possible. We were on the sixth floor and had no view.2. Do not use the valet parking service as it is about $60 right next to the hotel is a self park for $20. The valet even told us where it was.3. Have the concierge recommend the bike tour company to used bicycle across the Golden gate Bridge. You get a discount card and it is a lot of fun. You then take the ferry back to San Francisco.4. Do not rely on the courtesy car service. It seemed to me that they only had one vehicle and it was always in use. It was far easier to use Uber or yelp.5. As I mentioned above make sure you have a drink in the bar as it is a very lively place to socialize.
"Stayed at this hotel for one night and received excellent service at check in, restaurant, bell boy and room service.Great room and on an early check in. Staff could not have been more helpful. Pricey but worth the cost."
"Great location, great service, great food! The rooms are spacious. And we were on the 10th floor so the views were spectacular! The service was personalized and attentive. We had room service for breakfast and I must say: order the lemon ricotta pancakes! Delicious! We also attended a wedding at this hotel and the food was excellent! The balcony off the reception area was great for picture taking."
Great Hotel well worth the price would go back again.Dinner in the hotel was excellent with wonderful staff & outstanding food. We really value Four Season hotel generally but San Fran is one of the best.
"The hotel is great, perfect location to go and walk around the city.Room service, valet parking and the cleaning ladies where more than excellent.We had a little inconvenient when the hotel decided to change locks during our stay with out telling us, they have text message to welcome you that they didn't use to give us a notice about the improvements. Not even a note was sent to our room, we got there in a hurry at the time they were working and the manager ask us to wait 10 min, we couldn't agree with him and got into our room to continue with our schedule, of course there was a mess that we have to ignore. When we got back we have to upgrade keys as part of the improvement. Not complaining about the upgrades, but I was very upset that this great place didn't check with us previously on doing the work.Other than that this is a fantastic hotel with a good costumer service."
"I always love staying at the Four Seasons in San Francisco because of the way the staff treats each of their clients and they anticipate each and every need. This local is prime for the trolley to the waterfront, muni to Castro or BART to the airport. Plenty of shopping near by. "
"Four Seasons is in a really good location in San Francisco. Hotel and rooms are well appointed and in excellent shape. Staff and concierge are very professional, friendly and proficient. Very easy to recommend this property."
"Lydia served us room service several times, she's and excellent employee who really understands customer service. I've been a member at the Four Seasons in Dallas for 19 years, have been to a Four Seasons over 2000 times, and she stands out as a leader in serving the customer. "
"We stayed at the Four Seasons Tuesday-Saturday and had a great time. The location is central to everything we wanted to do. The room was spectacular (#1626) with loads of space. We did not eat in the restaurant as there are so many amazing restaurants within walking distance. When my husband asked where I wanted to stay, I said ""The Four Seasons, definitely!"" We're glad we did!"
"No matter what city I travel to, if there is a Four Seasons I book it. The consistency and service in these Hotels are second to none. I find the rooms quiet and beds are superior. Concierge always knows the best restaurants to book"
"This is a great hotel. However, beware that the double-bed rooms come with full, not queen beds. If your a XL-person, they are much smaller than a queen (at least it seemed like it). Otherwise, this place is great."
There are many great four seasons but some that are not so great. The property in San Francisco is tired and very much in need of a redo. Expensive and nothing particular to recommend it. I'd find another place until it gets a serious update. 
I choose Four Seasons over all the other hotels because I am guaranteed a top quality experience. They have always exceeded my expectations. I recommend Four Seasons to all travellers. I hope they expand their hotels into all of the other cities that I travel to.
Always a great choice when visiting San Francisco. If you visit soon be aware the adjacent construction will wake you up at 7:00 am even on Saturday! Hotel is first class and staff very attentive and friendly.
"Disappointed with the qualtity of room at this property. The lobby was lovely, the staff amazing, but, the food ok and the room like a Sheraton. They definitely need to update the rooms for the price you pay here. "
"Like all Four Seasons this hotel makes you feel special: Friendly valet, friendly concierge , free good coffee and tea and newspaper summary in the lounge outside MKT restaurant and a great location that makes everything within walking distance from the hotel.If you are taking Uber to the hotel be forewarned: only taxis and buses are allowed in Market street. The valet and the entrance is in Stevenson Street."
We had such a good time there. It was a perfect birthday weekend. The staff were great and the restaurant was excellent. The scallops were the best I've eaten and lychee martini and chocolate cake were delicious!
"There is no better hotel in SF. We've stayed at many high end hotels in SF and each one has its own personality. If you want just the best in luxury, cleanliness, service, food, location, a great health club make your reservations at the Four Seasons! It is our home away from home!"
This was the first time we ever stayed at The Four Seasons. It was our best experience ever! The valet service was remarkable and the service was excellent!! The king size bed and bedding was absolutely AMAZING and we slept like ROYALTY. We would definately stay at this hotel again and recommend it to EVERYONE!!!
"Just returned from a short stay. The front desk made late check in very easy and streamlined. Door staff was very attentive and ready to render assistance. The rooms are very spacious. You do not feel closed in, yet lost in so much space. The window bench a great value. The bed is very comfortable.The hotel claims to be green-focused. They are moving in a good direction with optional daily or every third day linen change. There are room to improve. Daily towel changes for single occupants might not be necessary. As with the linen, allow guests to hang up the towels if we are willing to reuse or drop in the tub if we wish a fresh set. Having the ability to reset the AC, is helpful, but is the automatic setting at 65 really necessary? Agreed that we experienced a wide array of weather (heat wave to thunder/lightning storm). This is San Francisco where the temperature is rather temperate."
"We have stayed at several Four Seasons Hotels throughout the country and even chose to have our wedding at a Hawaii location. We appreciate the attention to detail and great staff. Unfortunately, we were highly disappointed with our recent experience at Four Seasons San Francisco., it just didn't live up to the typical Four Seasons experience. The hotel appeared understaffed with long waits for restaurants and a lack of attention to order details. Our room was nice but was also disappointing. In room movies played at such a low volume they could barely be heard, cords and outlets were lacking for a modern hotel experience. We do not plan on staying at this location in the future. "
"We traveled to San Francisco for my husband's birthday and decided to stay at the Four Seasons since we absolutely LOVED our stay at FS Bora Bora last year. We realized it's a different type of stay (city vs island) but we definitely experienced the same level of hospitality. Concierge was extremely helpful in assisting us plan our daily itinerary (renting bikes/cars, sight seeing etc). Shout-out to Thomas Jeung - super helpful when we wanted to bike across the GGB! Loved the multi-color Sharpie routes he drew on our map :) We were a bit worried about the area since we heard it's close to Tenderloin and Mission areas but the area is certainly cleaning up. We never felt unsafe but we did see some homeless people while walking down Market Street we that comes with many major cities. It's close to Union Square and a very comfortable walk to Chinatown. Transit is just across the street if you wanted to take a bus to Haight-Ashbury or the cable cars to Fisherman's Wharf. If you are planning on renting a car, it will be dropped off on backside of the hotel - it's like a small secret alleyway. Room itself was spacious - we were on the 11th floor, corner suite. Beds very comfy, TV has a ton of channels, big bathroom (the configuration was a tad odd and the only hooks were far away from the shower/bathtub). Complimentary bottled water given every day. They also have fresh fruit infused water at the front desk - very yummy! Only super minor thing was a hair dryer that didn't work so had to call front desk at 1:30am and was provided with another one within 15 mins! We also asked for a microwave and was provided with one as well! Suggestion would be to have a plug in the mini-bar area so the microwave could be put there instead of the big table. Overall, a very enjoyable stay and great experience! Highly recommend :)"
"Beautiful rooms, excellent restaurant and incredible service provided by concierge. The hotel location is perfect.Many restaurants nearby the hotel, we loved going to the Ferry Building and walking to Pier 39 "
"They were so accommodating. The room was very quiet, never heard a hall door close or people talking. Cleaning service was very unobtrusive. Text messaging for service was very convenient. Excellent breakfast options. "
"Loved everything about this hotel! Nice location, walking distance to good restaurants and shopping. The staff are friendly and professional. As globe trotters, we are familiar with outstanding hotels in other parts of the world. This one in San Francisco didn't disappoint. So happy! "
"This was my first time staying at a Four Seasons hotel and I was impressed with both the property and the service. The room was beautiful and clean and I loved the deep soaking bathtub and separate shower. The breakfast and room service were wonderful. The valet assisted in finding a cab for me when I had to get to the airport very early in the morning. I would stay here again and now that I am familiar with the brand, I would trust Four Seasons elsewhere. Thank you for an exceptional experience. "
"What you expect from a four seasons, if youre thinking of booking here then you know what you are getting - however it should be noted the food here was elevated to another level. Great spot if you're in SF and want a name-you-know."
"Great location Rooms and bathrooms are spacious and clean. Separate shower is a plus! Bathroom products average, nothing spectacular like I would expect from a 5-star hotel Loved the thick, plushy bathrobe and the disposable sleepers Couldn't use the phone to check out - appeared to not be working"
We traveled to San Francisco to celebrate a very special birthday. I have stayed at this hotel many times and it never disappoints! You feel at home with the wonderful staff and the product is beyond luxury.
The hotel was the best. The staff was very friendly and went out of their way to help you. We were there for a wedding and the food was the best I ever had. The room was spacious and the view was beautiful. There were places to visit within walking distance. The 2 negatives were no coffee pot in the room and the valet parking was very pricey.
"A very, very nice hotel accommodations were very comfortable and the staff were very friendly. I would recommend this hotel to any out of towners who are looking for an expensive hotel to stay in. The only reason we stayed in this hotel is that our friend's daughter got married here and it was convenient."
"Had a quick overnight stay. Finding the valet is tricky, not where google maps take you. As always service is quick, friendly, and tip top. Hotel is in a great location with so many walkable options. The negative is that the room was tired, and well worn. We didn't have any problems with noise even being on an extremely busy street. I think also is the negative is the price gauging. I get that its a luxury hotel but 8$ for a to go coffee. With so many options in San Fransisco. If staying at this price point explore other options."
"We are three friends currently staying in the four seasons hotel in san francisco (market str/ union square)The reasons we chose this hotel was due to our european perception that everything was flawless at four seasons, which the price per room would also suggest.Here are our findings:Our stay - (unless we can cancel rest of days)is 31st august to 6th of septemberPrice rooms : 480-490 usd per night Valey parking : 65 usd / nightBreakfast: 40(!) usd / day/ ppTot: circa 600 usd / nightWe were told by phone that amenities included pool facilities and booked with credit card over phone.When we showed up the pool was under construction - hence ruining half the experience.Rooms :- nothing at all special (and rooms at that rate are in our case placed on 6th floor - first living floor next to no view)- clean with nice beds- insanesly expensive mini-bar ( 40 usd for half a bottle of champagne)Breakfast:We prepaid breakfast for our stay.This worked only as a money reservation and if left unused, we would be billed this per day anyway- hence why do it?The price to eat a normal breakfast for three people is circa 120 usd - all is ala carte and greedily expensive. - example 8 usd cup of normal coffee!!Service:All very friendly and attentativeBartenders mixed great cocktailsFood was ok but all things considered stupidly expensive.The general perception would be that our value for money would be higher at a 4 star hotel, and likely more luxourios.Stay away!"
"First off, I am BRAND LOYAL and most of the time LOVE The Four Seasons... and I've stayed in some of the coolest ones around the world... so, when I remain brand loyal and book a hotel based on my loyalty... I expect the brand to live up to my expectations. The Four Seasons in San Francisco is 'okay.' I have stayed at a lot of Four Seasons and this one is just 'okay' so it gets a 3. In my opinion this is not one of their better properties. Deluxe King was smaller than usual and the little things that bug me at any hotel stood out... dusty furniture, bathrooms that need some love and we sent the food back twice due to allergy requests being forgotten or missed... so we ate in shifts. Duck Fat Fries are the bomb and the server was very nice.Too many options (nicer choices) in the city to settle for a 3 Star Four Seasons when you expect one thing and it's not what you pay for in a brand. "
"From the valet/bell guys, front desk staff, bartender, housekeeping staff, all amazing and outstanding service. had the pleasure to stay 2 nights while attended a wedding at this hotel and felt like one of their own, I had a leg injury prior to my stay and they were always concerned for my well being, offering the bring up ice to my room each time. just a great group of staff which made the already great hotel even more great. the bar/bartenders were friendly and cozy. drink and food menu was all great quality. especially appreciated the whisky selection at the bar, shoes great taste and class. couldnt be more happy with my stay."
We come to the city to immerse ourselves in the hustle bustle. But by the end of the day need a refuge that's quiet and comfortable. Four Seasons has been that refuge in many locations. San Francisco is one of the best we've experienced.
"I stayed in a small suite with a very limited view, but the windows open, and if you pay extra for the internet it works quite well. The hotel utilizes a very large Equinox gym next door (with a connected hallway) which is great if you like a lot of equipment, but not so great if you are hoping for a 5 star hotel uncrowded experience. The ""spa"" is certainly something to be missed...Apparently in order to reduce electricity usage the air conditioner becomes very weak after about midnight and my room became hot each night for a few hours...probably not often a huge issue in San Francisco but not a 5 star experience. Concierge was great and helpful."
A classic Four Seasons hotel. We really enjoy the understated quality/elegance of this chain. Service was attentive/sharp/friendly. Wife loved elevator access to multi-floor gym. Turkey BLT room ordered was huge. Downside - expensive.
"We have stayed at this hotel several times and it never disappoints. The staff is excellent at the front desk, restaurants, housekeeping and concierge. The food in the restaurant and bar/lounge is fabulous. We absolutely love the breakfast! I can't say enough good things about this property. We love Equinox too! Great time - every time! Great for adults and our boys love it there too!"
"I have been in many ,four seasons . Paris , London ,,NY, HK .This one ,SF is the most terrible Ever,It started with a room that smell cigarettes in a very high level and I had to wait for that as the room was not readyAt the front desck people do not have your info and you Must go again and again over it,,..I'll not recommend anyone to go there"
"We stayed at the Four Seasons to see a theater performance at the SHSN. The staff was friendly, efficient and professional. They answered our questions and greeted us each time we came and went from the hotel. It was wonderful. We decided to take BART to the theater which was a good decision. The BART line was literally steps away and easy to navigate. The Four Seasons staff made our trip one to remember with fondess"
"Very good hotel - catered to our every need with prompt responses to requests. Very polite staff (not always the case in North American hotels!) , excellent location close to plenty of eating options/tourist sights The room itself was definitely not plush or luxurious but by SF standards was spacious and clean. "
"Great location, top rooms, service is outstanding. The staff makes you feel like a super VIP along your stay. The hotel is close to the financial districts, but is also ideal for guys visiting the city. "
"My wife and I chose to stay here for our 32nd wedding anniversary. Everything was excellent. Very friendly staff that made us feel welcome. Everyone had a smile on their face. We spent a few different times in the bar relaxing with a cocktail after a long day of shopping, they were awesome. The wait staff from the bar were the ones who gave us some really GREAT places to go out for dinner or lunch that were places where the locals go to eat. They really helped to make for such a great stay at The Four Seasons. THANK YOU!!!!"
"Stayed here for two nite's on a trip planned last minute. The entrance on Market immediately takes you from the hectic street sometimes overpopulated with persons describing most nicely as odd, to a quite exquisite furnished main floor from where you need to ascend 4 stories to the lobby. The lobby has the bar-restaurant where breakfast is served. It is furnished very tastefully as are the rooms. You have use of the super Equinox health club that occupied the first 3 floors of the same building. Previously I stayed at the Ritz, which is also beautiful, but was $300 more a nite's this stay."
"The FS is located next to Union Square, which is a perfect spot in SF. There is plenty shopping and restaurants all around you so that shouldn't be a problem. The property is pretty standard for a FS. The only inconvenience is the elevators. You have to take two different elevators because registration is on the fifth floor. The rooms are large for SF standards. They are clean and comfortable with great views of the city. The bathrooms are also large for SF standards with solid showers and a bathtub. The staff is great. They are all very helpful and friendly. Bottom line, if you want a high end hotel room in SF then you can't go wrong by staying here. "
The restaurant is very nice and it is quick. The rooms are very cosy beds are comfy restrooms are big . They have big TVs and big rooms. Elevators are a bit confusing. Kind people and help with what they can. A enjoyable stay
"Consistent excellent service, facilities, business friendly rooms, great ambience, lively bar, amazing helpful staff, great location and love the access to the best Equinox pool and gym , the concierge provided personalised service"
"You can't do any better than this hotel. Everything is first class from service, location and facilities. The restaurant also serves one of the best hamburgers ever. We stay in many first class hotels but this is the best that we know of in big cities."
I very much enjoyed my stay and will definitely look forward to returning when in San Francisco. I understand the hotel is getting ready to renovate and am very excited to see the completed project. The beds are already so incredibly comfortable and the location is perfect. I'd like to recognize Damien in accounting and the wonderful server who waited on me Tuesday night. Both exemplify true hospitality.
"We have had a wonderful stay my dad and I in this hotel. It's maybe an expensive hotel but it is totally worth it. The staff is very nice and welcoming, always wondering if you need anything. The location is perfect. It's also one of the best breakfast we ever had (lemon ricotta pancakes are the best thing ever)."
"Great hotel in an ideal location. Concierge team were great and helpful. Other members of staff were also courteous. Service and breakfast was top notch. Only downside is that the rooms are tired and old, the hotel is in need for a refurbishment. "
"+ great room, bedding , shower pressure, cleanliness, TV- absurd prices at breakfast ($7 for glass of milk, $10 for espresso, etc.); you have to change elevators from ground floor to reach guest roomsnormally I could not give 5 stars with the breakfast pr"
"We had checked into another hotel and it was disgusting. We wanted a good experience for our honeymoon. So we searched and found the Four Seasons and decided to upgrade our experience. They had a great deal of ""stay four nights and get the fifth free"". The front desk employees were gracious and helpful. Just what we needed. Beautiful corner room with sweeping view of the Metreon and AT&T park, as well as the Bay. An immensely enjoyable experience."
"We arrived with high expectations after previously staying at the Four Seasons in Arizona and Beverley Hills and couldn't have been more disappointed.There is nothing special about this hotel, service was average, we had reserved a King Suite, the first one stank of smoke even though this hotel has been no smoking for years and they moved us to another, which was identical but without the smokey smell. Large room but nothing startling about it.We then moved on to Napa and had one night in a Hampton Inn and Suites before moving on to a luxury hotel and the Hampton Inn and Suites was far superior to the Four Seasons! Unbelievable."
"Perfect low key hotel in great area of San Francisco. Rooms were great, loved the padded window seat and great view. We enjoyed the gym too! Suggest if you can get room rate including breakfast. In a busy hectic city is was a joy each day to return to a nice rest at the Four Seasons."
"The hotel & service was 5 stars. Our room had nice views. The restaurant was excellent. The hotel was close to everything. Easy check in & out. Would recommend this hotel for a getaway. Walgreen's, coffee houses, restaurants walking distance. "
"I staid there for three nights for business and the rooms were large and the lobby, etc. were fancy in an old school way. For the cost of the stay (which was pretty impressive) it did not seem very special though. I definitely wouldn't spend my own money there. It just lacked a touch of modern without being historical - so it came across as a bit tired. I did like the central location near SOMA though."
"Have stayed at Four Seasons many times both in SF and around the world.Great hotel and front office staff however this location is marred by subpar restaurant, restaurant staff and room service.This level luxury hotel in a foodie capital needs to step up its game big time to justify its cost and to live up to its reputation.The drafty restaurant featured apathetic servers with visibly disdainful kitchen staff who very clearly didn't care about either the food or the customer. Had to send our meal back 3x!! For fried eggs and toast! The room service was equally disappointing, not able to get boxed lunches right. Not good.Such a shame because beautiful hotel, lovely room and great location. But it'll likely be the St. Regis next time."
"I stay at the Four Seasons on Market Street whenever I can. Not only is the hotel top-notch, but the Equinox (formerly Sports Club LA) offers a huge, well-appointed fitness facility to hotel guests. As I generally travel for business and primarily use hotels for sleeping and working out, the fitness center matters to me as much as if not more than the room. Luckily at the Four Seasons it's not a trade-off; both are top-notch. And the staff are terrific as well. Highly recommended!"
"It is perfectly located at the heart of the city, close to the cable car stops, stores and MOMA. However quality and range of amenities are far below the standard of ordinary Four Seasons. Room is not spacious or fashionable even though we were upgraded to the deluxe class. "
"Well, this hotel is as Expected. Fabulous service, polite staff through. The beds are amazing. The location is Triple AAA, right in the middle of everything.Excellent! It is in the middle of the Hub Bub but yet it is secluded and quiet."
"This was our third time in a Four Seasons Hotel so we could not get disappointed about the services. We have been many times in San Francisco. Our last visit to the city was in 2010. A lot of time has passed and many things have changed since then. The city is still really wonderful with a vibration you can not find anywhere else. Visited again all the attractions and fell in love once again with the city. This is really a special place to visit. The only disappointing thing was the unbelievably high number of homeless people on the streets. I have to say there are definitely more than it was 7 years ago. I was told SF is a sanctuary city so immigration is very easy and the city is very welcoming and open to new comers.Traffic was not a nightmare although there were constructions and road works on many places.Regarding the stay in Four Seasons the hotel is located in the centre of the city that was very good and easy for us to access shops, restaurants or just to go out for a walk. Everything is really in a walkable distance. We were accommodated in a junior suite which was clean and nice with a separated large living and also a large bedroom. The bed was one of the best I have ever slept on. And sleeping quality was also very good. No disturbing noises, everything was really nice. Be aware of there is only one bathroom in the junior suite.The staff was extremely friendly and supportive. MKT bar also had a marvelous vibe we loved to have a drink there in the evenings. Good cocktails and wines and my favorite champagne. Loved it :)Our most favorite about the hotel was that it has an iphone application that you can use to order food from room service or request your car from valet parking or just ask the housekeeping to clean your room. This was really fantastic I could order breakfast via the application without even leaving the bed and without calling the staff. This made our stay so much comfortable and much easier. We were absolutely satisfied with the food quality, have ordered many times not only breakfast but lunch and dinner as well.We loved the attentive and personalized service we have got here. You can just imagine small things which made our stay really wonderful. You can really let go your problems and just focus on your holiday. Everyone is there to make you feel better. Last but not least I felt safe in the hotel which is very important nowadays. No, there are no armed security guards but somehow this was my feeling when entering or spending time in the hotel's building.Regarding the prices the hotel is really expensive but if you have high quality expectations and also have the budget you will definitely not get disappointed. We really appreciate the service we have got here and I would like to say a big thank you for everything."
"I had stayed before on business some years ago but never before on holiday with my family. I was not disappointed - lively rooms in a high floor as requested, lovely food and very welcoming, friendly and professional staff. The location of the hotel is also good for exploring. All in all a very enjoyable stay and highly recommended."
"Staying at the spectacular Four Seasons hotel in heart of San Francisco, the most beautiful city. The attentive friendly staff, great bar & restaurant, spacious room and the hotel design was stunning and cozy. Your Cable Car to Nob Hill, Chinatown and Fisherman's Wharf is a few minutes away. I left my Heart in San Francisco and The Four Seasons."
"Had several issues during our stay. First was very disappointed with the products provided in our room. There were only the shampoo and conditioner when we arrived. We had to call for the additional items that had not been provided. Given this is the Four Seasons the presentation and availability of the products should be outstanding and we were disappointed. Secondly there were no newspapers. We spoke to the concierge about this and was told about the new digital policy which is absolutely unacceptable. Making things worse while on the elevator I saw a guest with a newspaper. He said he asked for one and got it. I was outraged that despite my conversation with the concierge I was not offered one: not a good thing for the ""Four Seasons"" and it's excellent reputation for service. Lastly we ate breakfast every morning in the dining room. One morning as we approached the hostess we were asked if we had reservations. No one had advised us to make reservations for breakfast. In addition we were told there would be a 15 minute wait The head host then arrived and when we approached him with this information he immediately took us into the dining room and offered us one of the many empty tables that were available. We were appalled by this and will not forget how we were treated. Next time we will choose another hotel. Lfevents@aol.com"
My 4th time staying there and everything was perfect as always. Every member of the staff is exceptionally well trained and dedicated to the ultimate client experience. We were actually sad to leave but luckily our next stop was the Ritz Carlton half moon bay which is another amazing experience. 
"Centrally located in the heart of the downtown. Premier shopping and restaurants are only blocks away. Morning walks to the Ferry Building, with views of the Bay Bridge are a must. Or stay on the property and enjoy one of the most impressive, full service gyms around."
"The staff was friendly, professional and extremely accommodating. I felt white glove treatment every step of the way! The In-Room dining service was exemplary and the location was convenient for the meetings in the city I was attending."
"The Four Seasons San Francisco is up to the high standards of Fours Seasons. Outstanding service at all levels, with fine in-room dining and professional doorman service. We enjoyed a beautiful corner guestroom, which I highly recommend. Primary competition for this hotel is the St. Regis and the Ritz Carlton, both of which I have stayed at and are fine properties; however, the Four Seasons San Francisco has a superior guestroom and bathroom design and a higher level of service."
I loved the large windows! Our room was clean and comfy. I appreciated the bathroom layout with the toilet area separate from the walk in shower. The staff at this property were very friendly. I would like to see more dining options as the one dining option and room service are the same menus. 
"Great food, good customer service, make sure to check out their restaurant, really yummy food. The drinks were amazing. One of the downfalls, is the deck, it is currently under construction. The check-in experience was really good."
"Its been a year sinnce my previous stay at this property. When complained last year, I was told that rooms will be refurbished soon. I am sorry to say that was an empty promise. Nothing has change. The whole facility needs an urgent total renovation. Major renovation. Service is slow and slopy"
This hotel gives an oasis of calm and quality. It never seems crowded or rushed as some of its bigger neighbors. The staff goes out of their way to accommodate you. Very pleased with our trip and would love to return anytime
"My daughter and I recently enjoyed 3 nights at this lovely San Francisco hotel. In our recent visits to San Francisco we stayed at the Ritz and at the Fairmont, but this is absolutely our favorite hotel the city and is where we will stay when our travels bring us back to San Francisco. The rooms are bright and fairly large, the location is perfect and service is impeccable. One small criticism: the spa opens too late on the weekend."
"We stayed at the Four Seasons for three nights. It was everything you would expect, lovely accommodations, delicious food, great service. The hotel is located downtown so ask for a higher floor for better views. The Equinox gym attached to the hotel was a bonus, free for hotel guests, they had some really great classes. The only negative was that the concierge sent us to the pier for some really bad clam chowder and an hour wait for a trolley ride that was a major tourist trap. A trip to the museum would have been a better bet. I'm looking forward to returning and finding that perfect bowl of clam chowder!"
"This place is great! The staff is great equinox is downstairs, the windows open, I love that. The inroom dining is fabulous, the hotel is so nice and quiet in the rooms. Love the huge tv in my suite too. "
"Never stuffy, but always luxury and welcoming, this is our favorite hotel in San Fran. The staff is helpful, the room is comfortable, there is a spa, fitness and salon in the building and it's a great location"
"The Four Seasons is located in a great location. You are walking distance to almost anything you want to do. It is close to restaurants, shopping, grassy area for your dog.All of the employees are extremely courteous. The room was well appointed and very comfortable."
"If there's a perfect hotel in san francisco, this is it!!!!! 5 minutes away from union square, a mile away from embarcadero, and few minutes away from financial district. I would like to thank the concierge for doing whatever it takes to get what we requested for. Whether getting reservations at authentic seafood place, fixing a napa valley tour or scoring last minute alcatraz tickets. There were always options! Never a no. And i am so appreciative of that. It showed the team exerted all efforts to deliver all requests. I love the level of courteousness and professionalism of the team! Thanks so much!"
"Wonderful hotel, very attentive staff and right in the heart of downtown. We enjoyed walking and seeing different things in the downtown area. We didn't eat in their restaurant, so can't help there. We did visit the bar and it was very nice, both service and atmosphere."
The Four Seasons is always consistently high quality. The rooms are spacious. The bar and restaurant area is lively with excellent service. The hotel is also easy walking distance to many of the office buildings in the business district. 
"Excellent hotel-top notch accommodations, hospitality, staff, bar and restaurant! Encouraged both the business traveler and family to enjoy this lovely facility. Don't forget to visit the restaurant and bar for great food and fun!"
"The hotel is ok in general (good location, clean, quick response). One thing did not meet my expectation was : I put down ""it's our 6th anniversary"" in the request when I ordered the in-room dining. But there was nothing special on our plates. I would expect something such as writing with chocolate ""happy anniversary!"" on our plate to make our stay special (I would expect this for the $700 per night stay). And even we stay on 17th floor, it was quite noisy during the night due to ear piercing police car alarm. therefore, did not get a good night of sleep."
"Such beautiful clean rooms! Beds were so comfortable and room was impeccable! I really hated to leave and I never feel that way about leaving a hotel. Also, I Must acknowledge the great staff. Always accommodating and polite. Our family ate breakfast three mornings in a row at the hotel MKT Restaurant and we had the good fortune of having Joel as our server for two of the mornings. He gave us excellent service and was so kind to our kids! We did tons of walking and sightseeing but going back to the calm of The Four Seasons felt luxurious and welcoming at the end of a busy day."
"Excellent hotel, great staff, clean rooms and good location. Rooms are fresh, reflective of a city hotel. The gym was excellent. I would recommend to friends and family, and stay there again in the future. "
"Beginning with the warm greeting and gracious check-in process by the Assistant Manager, Nana Hattori, followed by the friendly and attentive service we received throughout our stay, culminated into yet another excellent guest experience at this Five Star worldwide establishment. As with other Four Seasons we've frequented, the two rooms our family stayed in were impeccably clean and well maintained. As for the rest factor, their bedding, as always, has been one of the better Five Star beds we've slept on. Traffic and street noise was barely noticeable, due to the insulation and being situated on the 12th and 16th floor. On this particular stay, we had in-room dining on three occasions and consistently found their entrees to be well prepared and surprisingly better than what some of the long standing restaurants in and around Union Square can prepare -kudos to Four Seasons' San Francisco Food and beverage team. In my opinion, if you're looking for a luxury stay near San Francisco's renown shopping area, Union Square, or its financial district, Four Seasons San Francisco is worthy to be on your short list."
Hotel location is great. The downside of this hotel there is no leisure swimming pool onsite they only offer a lap pool through equinox gym and kids are not allowed under 15 and 15and over must be with parents. This hotel isn't family friendly or friendly if your looking to relax by the pool the in evening or daytime. I wouldn't stay here .
"My room was light and airy, and I slept well the very first night. They had small, tasty muffins and hot coffee in the morning. Room service was very good. Don't forget to visit the nearby institute of art!"
Once you arrive the doorman is there to open your car door and greet you. Welcome to Four Seasons. The front desk agents upstairs can be seen as you get off the elevators smiling and acknowledging your presence. We were lucky to be given one of the new renovated rooms. The owners of the building (Millennium Partners) really went all out. The service was amazing. There are employees that have been there from day one. We will be back.
Our Four Seasons stay was nothing but pleasurable. The hotel was pristine and the front desk on check in and check out were prompt and courteous. Housekeeping made the room seem as if we just checked in every day of our stay. The concierge desk were extremely helpful with suggestions and arranging outings and dinners. The restaurant and bar staff were equally prompt in their service.
"In brief, the expectations associated with the Four Seasons brand are both met and exceeded in San Francisco. Highest luxury, which is augmented with excellent staff. I look forward to staying here again."
"This is a great hotel, like most Four Seasons. Not sure the cost is quite worth it when traveling for leisure, however. Overall it was a very good stay, but everything is expensive, and it's not flawless. For example, the oysters at the bar were not good. Our room wasn't ready for early check-in, and we had to deal with a false fire alarm (which involved walking down 10 flights of stairs with luggage)."
"Whenever I travel to a city with a Four Seasons property, I struggle with whether or not to explore other brands or stick with the best. Our recent trip to San Francisco reinforced a stick with the best approach. We were in a gorgeous corner room overlooking Market St. with Chinatown in the distance. But our view and room was equally matched with the unmistakable Four Seasons service. We encountered it everywhere we went in the hotel. Stay here: you won't regret it."
"Great location and Hotel. Rooms are beautiful, I had a corner unit with an amazing view. Service as in any Four Seasons is always great and above expectations. I did not have the chance to try any of the Food and Beverage outlets."
"Best situated in the center of SF. First class hotel, perfekt Service, especially concierce team. Had a room with exelent view over the city. Could use the well equiped Equinox Fitness Center! Best Place to be in a fascinating City ! "
"Yes, the Four Seasons San Francisco is expensive (as other commenters have noted) but like all things in life, you get what you pay for. Moreover, the hotel frequently offers a stay 'stay 4 nights, get the 4th free' rate that makes it very competitive compared to other top hotels in the city.The hotel itself exudes a modern 'business' vibe which may not be to everyone's liking. That said, the rooms are large and luxurious (and getting an update next year I believe). Staff is very attentive. Room service is extremely fast. And for those seeking a gym, there's a swanky outpost of the Equinox downstairs.The location is walking distance to the Embarcadero and many good restaurants. And the food in the bar is good, too. It's a wonderful place to stay in a great city."
Very good hotel but extreme expensive. Big rooms and good service. Bar is not cosy and breakfast is good but also very expensive. Free access to big and very good gym. Great location and union square is on walking distance. 
"As always, Four Season SF does not disappoint. Service was great, the bar was cool, and breakfast was delicious. I would recommend staying at the Four Season SF for a weekend getaway or business. Top notch service!"
"I've decided the Four Seasons is my favorite. The staff is gracious, warm and welcoming. They are the loveliest group. The hotel atmosphere is unique in that it feels luxurious and down to earth, at the same time. Every single employee provided exceptional and personalized service. It's extraordinary. Most importantly, the Four Seasons provided excellent value. Guests may also use the Equinox gym in the building. For late night room service, I recommend the turkey burger and the bar/restaurant has terrific apps and brunch. My only tip is to consider asking housekeeping for additional products as the one shower gel for 2 people was a bit skimpy. "
"Natahlie, Front Desk arrival was so welcoming and professional as was Bridget upon our departure. A truly lovely visit enhanced by Timothy's insights at Concierge, thanks to the doorman who was always helpful and warm, sorry we didn't catch his name, also very pleased with driver back to airport. All in all, a brief whirlwind visit to San Francisco but a welcome landing at Four Seasons."
extremely well-located hotel in SF with top-notch trained employees that understand their clientele. the breakfast credit almost covers a sumptuous breakfast lol...nice larger rooms with Bvlgari products in the bathroom. Suites are very large and nice and price point is competitive.
"Everything was excellent, the only single flaw was the hard sell at the restaurant for breakfast, the staff were haughty, they could not accept the answer NO for water, as these 2 items were atrousciously expensive and easy way to increase billing amount."
"Great staff! Good food! Good location. Not a very clean bathroom which makes me wonder, ""How clean is it in the areas that are not so easy to see. In my experience, every single person I have had contact there was absolutely wonderful."
"One of the best times we have had in SFO. The staff was very accommodating, friendly and helpful. From the moment we arrived until we left the staff took care of all of our needs. The room was excellent and we had a most relaxing time. Can't wait to go back!"
"I have stayed here several times. Mostly had expentional experiences. This was my frirst stay as I am expecting my first child. Lost a an heirloom from an Aunt that passed a little over aweek ago while taking off my earrings to get into bed. I kindly asked the room to be searched and was never followup with. Suffering morning sickness during departure I left a few expensive and sentimental items behind. I to rush to airport because morning sickness had taken it's toll. When I called about my things and requested to speak to Housely he delegated the task. I was treated poorly so asked for Housely to please call. I answered cheerfully. Finally, the kind empathic GM that would put me at ease finally called. No, he placed me on a group call specifically with the lower management that spoke over me and did not listen. Housely was impolite and firm. Felt like an interrogation and would not speak to me one on one as I requested. He left me in tears and hung up on me. He did nothing to reassure that they would check again, he did not say he valued us as guests, he did not even remember meeting me in the past. He did not not offer any solution, not even to shop the items that were found, instead he hung up on a high risk pregnant guest of FS SF in tears."
I have stayed in a few Four Seasons resorts and they have all been outstanding. This hotel did the job but did not blow me away. The room we stayed in was large and in good condition. The breakfast in the hotel was a la carte and good. The gym is massive. The pool was large but cold - definitely for lengths rather than lounging. I would be very happy to stay here again but I am not sure I could justify the price premium vs another central chain hotel in the city.
I went here for my birthday. I walked into the room and was greeted by a nice birthday amenity of wine and nuts. The concierge was helpful with suggestions on where to eat. The hotel was QUIET. I never heard slamming doors or people talking in the hallways. Overall it was an amazing stay!
"A wonderful hotel that lived entirely up to its reputation. We were treated like royalty, with every request honored within minutes. Centrally located and especially close to Gumps, the best store in town. We will never again stay anywhere else in San Francisco."
"Firstly. Check in on the fifth floor. Very easy from street side or the parking / drop off area. The room is business like but good quality and plenty of space. The bedding is always so good at the Four Seasons. Check in was brisk and easy and friendly. There's a good bar here too. We got together for drinks and appetizers. Good quality, good choices with some twists on traditional bites. Would have loved to have stayed longer. Good location, great service, good quality. What you'd expect. "
"It's so nice! The lost and found services are so good! My mom thought she lost her scarf and I called the hotel about the issues. Later on, my mom said she found it in the house. Surprisedly, the hotel called me that they can't find it and they will contact the housekeeping department and give me the follow up. Some hotel won't even try to look for it. They are so nice!!"
Nice hotel with friendly staff. Difficult to find hotel by car so make sure GPS has correct address. I had a fantastic view of the city from our room. Overall the stay was very pleasurable. I would definately stay here again.
"We had a superb stay at the SF four Seasons. We were beautifully looked after, the service exceptional, room very comfortable. The concierge team we helpful and friendly, they helped us with reservations at restaurants and Alcatraz and went out of their way to help us. We will definitely stay with you again..."
This property has a fantastic location and near almost anything you want to do in San Fran. From major shopping to sightseeing you really couldn't find a better spot! The service is superb and assistance from Conciege invaluable- also easiest check in/check out ever. All staff were extraordinary in being super pleasant and courteous- we would stay here in a heartbeat the next time we visit this great city!!!
I stay at Four Seasons for business and this time they upgraded me to a corner room which was roomy and fabulous with great view. Staff was just wonderful. Hotel is great to have meetings in the lobby.
"We are seasoned travelers, and the Four Seasons never disappoints. Room, bar/restaurant, and service are outstanding. They have nearly every detail covered, and are one of the few hotel chains who manage to deliver high quality guest services consistently across properties."
The hotel is in prime location in the city and all it's attractions. The staff makes you comfortable and at home with exceptional appointments. In-room dining was a treat after a long day. Bravo to all.
"No bargin hunters here. Everything is very good and you pay for it. Restaurant was great for breakfast but again pricey. Service was excellent, a little too fast. I was on a vacation and wanted to lollygag a bit at the table. Room, bathroom and common area where all first rate. Staff was very polite and very formal. San Fransisco is becoming a sewer and the problem is right outside the hotel. Nothing they can do about it but it does dampen the experience. "
Outstanding in every respect. Excellent location. First class service. Friendly efficient staff. Beautiful suite with a good view. Very nice restaurant. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in a top class five-star hotel in San Francisco.
"Every staff member was beyond helpful. We stopped by the concierge desk daily (sometimes twice a day) to ask for advice or recommendations. No matter who was on duty, they listened to our request and gave excellent advice on how to make it happen. They were knowledgeable about the best mode of transportation to get to any given destination, quick to pull out a map and mark a route for us, and always friendly. Our room was on the 10th floor facing Market Street. A window seat ran the width of our room, and we often sat there enjoying the view. Large bathroom, big tub (didn't use), spacious glass shower with excellent water pressure. Comfy beds. Overall a highly enjoyable stay."
"I had an amazing experience at the Four Seasons in San Francisco. Every expectation was met! The atmosphere was relaxing, the food terrific and the service even better. I will definitely make a return trip!"
"words are not enought o expalin to desribe the beauty and welcome and hospitality of this hotel. four season are known for thier hospitality,staff is very friendly,bar has the best choice of everything u want , and food is delicious,firness centre is amazing,over all a great experiece for great palce and great location and great service."
"The hotel is a bit dated, but the quality of the service and food and helpful nature of the staff make up for it. The bar is a fine spot to relax before dinner and watch both locals and visitors discuss the business of the day. The chef and staff did a fine job with a black tie dinner we attended. The central local is great for touring, on foot, via BART or other public transportation, or in your own car, which most people avoid."
"San Francisco Four Seasons was one of the best Four Seasons Hotels we stayed at. We had very good service, the building was in superb shape and quality. The artwork was enjoyable. Ww had breakfast everyday and the quality of the food was great. Very recommendable and good value."
"I had a great stay here, the staff was so friendly and helpful, the room was very large and well-appointed, bath amenities were great, good lighting in the bathroom plus a makeup mirror, always appreciated. Great location right on Market St. Access to the fantastic Equinox Fitness Center, so much nicer than a small room with a few treadmills. With all the coffee shops around I understand no coffee maker in the room but that is one thing I missed."
"The staff went out of their way to ensure that we had the best weekend experience. Our suite was amazing, the location was convenient, and all of the staff were incredibly courteous. We'll definitely be returning to this Four Seasons!"
"I expecting more from Four Season.Old and not fine furnitures.The housekeeper never refill the bath articles, as Shampoo, body lotion, etc.The pool and spa are for the public.We wait 45 minutes for check-in."
"I love the location of the hotel in San Francisco. It's close to several major sight seeing places, yet far enough from the crowds. It's just less than 10 mins from Fisherman's Wharf. This hotel has excellent service and great staff. I felt very welcomed and comfortable at this hotel."
Had a great experience at this hotel...location and services were top notch. Housekeeping staff was especially courteous and efficient - made it a real pleasure to come back to your room having organized what you left out of place !
The 4 Seasons is perfectly located for touring downtown SF. The rooms were very clean. I can't say much about view because there wasn't much of one. Hotel staff was very nice. Food was excellent. Bar service was really good even while the place was jam packed.
"instead of being overly wordy... Room was outdated, sleep was just ok, bothersome getting to and from room, had to ask toilet to get cleaned the moment we arrived. I travel 50 plus nights a year, my wife stays at home and is easily impressed... she wasn't impressed and this is the 4 seasons where the stay ought to be second to none."
"The service in this hotel was exceptional, friendly, and they went above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable & enjoyable as possible. The rooms are tired and need an update, and when they do their reno which i understand will be this summer, the bathrooms should have double sinks in them. Beds & bedding were wonderful and the location is fantastic."
"This Four Seasons is in a bad area with homeless, panhandlers, and badly littered streets just outside the hotel. Surprisingly anyone can walk in, go to the 5th floor lobby, then go to the guest elevators and ride up to any floor with no entry security for the elevators. The wi fi/charging tables in the lobby were often in use by people that did not appear to be hotel guests, but just locals in need of an Internet connection. The noise from the street performers outside was so loud on the amplifiers that it made it difficult to nap in our 14th floor room during the afternoon. We were there for 4 nights and were disappointed as well with the little things that make a hotel special. For instance: one morning housekeeping had not replaced the coffee/milk in our room so we couldn’t make morning coffee (the same day the Wall Street Journal was not delivered) – so it was up and down to the lobby to get coffee and the paper. Another day our bathrobe was taken by housekeeping – took over an hour to get it replaced. We tried to get our shoes shined – instructions were to call for pick up and not leave them outside in the bag – we called At 8 PM, waited 1 ½ hour, and then cancelled and went to bed. This was not an inexpensive stay – for example breakfast for 2 – coffee and the least expensive eggs – was $75 plus. This Four Seasons is unfortunately not up to the standards of others we have stayed at in New York, Chicago, and Los Colinas Texas."
"From the valet, the front desk team, the room service food and personnel, the restaurant, the beyond ""warm"" bar atmosphere during a Warriors game, ...perfection! The location is terrific for my business needs. Cannot say enough about the amazing staff. I will see you soon.!"
"I had a group recently stay at this hotel and 5 stars is not a true rating for the experience. I wish tripadvisor had a 10 star rating, because this hotel and specifically Joe Paybarah was off the charts amazing. Joe did a fantastic job and should be commended for his customer satisfaction and attention to detail. I have recommended this hotel to other groups and have a group that would like to come to the hotel next summer based upon my recommendation and comments of the hotel and Joe. Joe, thank you again for your amazing service."
"A very well maintained stylish hotel with the highest level of service, and in a great location in San Francisco. It is so easy to walk, or use the trolley/bus, or subway, as well as taxi or car service, of course. Very very comfortable."
We were there for vacation. Staying at this hotel made our stay in San Francisco more enjoyable and fun. Staff was courteous and polite from check-in to check-out. Restaurant was extremely good with great service and delicious food. Overall experience was really great. We would love to stay again at other locations as well.
"Stayed in San Francisco over Easter weekend. Service was amazing. Food was great. Location convenient. One day during the trip one of the kids started to ask us, ""Can I get...."". She stopped in mid-sentence and said, ""Never mind. Of course I can. We're staying at the Four Seasons."" That summed up our experience."
"This is a excellent hotel with outstanding service. However, i would strongly recommend travellers to avoid the 6th floor. The Equinox health club is one or two levels below and you will hear weights hitting the floor until 10pm and starting again at 5am next morning."
Great hotel with convenient location. Staff is top notch and rooms are well equipped. Excellent meeting space and food is well done. The hotel lobby bar is a great place to relax and the lobby is very spacious. Rooms are quite and are oversized for San Francisco.
"Ok, so we love the Four Seasons group of hotels. And what is not to love?! Once again the service was exceptional, incredibly professional & super friendly. The kids were beautifully accommodated (except for maybe not being able to use the swimming pool - my kids are great swimmers, so it being only a lap pool & therefore not for kids is not a great reason). Otherwise there was a lovely welcome gift for them, delicious (if a little limited) kids menus & all staff were fantastic.The food is excellent! The service & food in the restaurant for breakfast & dinner was superb. Room service was great! And Kelly served us twice for lunch in the bar, and she was fantastic.Centrally located, it is easy to get to the ferry terminal, metro, or cable cars and a wide variety of top end stores are within walking distance.Timothy, the concierge, also deserves a mention. He was incredibly helpful and friendly! Thanks for a great stay! "
"Beautiful property, top notch service from the minute you enter to departure.Excellent restaurant/bar staff.Beautiful corner room with windows on 2 sides. My go to San Fran hotel for business/pleasure."
"Everything was just perfect from checking in to checking out. The front desk staff was great and clearly the valet called up because they knew who I was as I walked up to check in. We are always staying at the Four Seasons, so getting an upgrade just felt good. The room service staff couldn't have been more efficient. I was very surprised at the high level of service I experience with every person I encountered during my stay. "
"Right downtown with access to the best gym possible, great stay! Great way to enjoy luxury and serenity in the middle of a vibrant city. The motor court entrance is a little hard to find since it is the back but everything is what you expect from a four seasons hotel."
Warmly greeted upon arrival. The hotel staff are extremely helpful and went beyond expectations to make dining reservations. The location is good fro visiting many of the SF landmarks. I would highly recommend staying in this hotel for families or for business
Great views and lovely and relaxed throughout the hotel. I was upgraded as I was getting married the next day and had a later checkout. The doorman are great and in the bar very accomodating to our vegan diet requirements. 
The hotel was excelent in every way. The room was so comfortable and staff amazing helpful. Every detail was catrered for effortlessly. The concierge was amazing. The bar and food were outstanding and the position of the Hotel perfect for all sites. We will be back.
difficult to say what. But; this maybe is a 5* hotel. With all it takes to be so. But; personality is missing; the nice small details that would it differ it from just being a big 5* hotel. And I do not mean the prices of breakfast. Once morning we spend ( 4 persons) 260$. I do not mind paying - but that is ridiculous. And then the details. Get these pumps at the doors to the rooms adjusted. No need to wake up the hole corridor when entering the room. A small detail but very annoying. The gym - great. But the pool (rather a regular swimming hal) - not a very charming place to be. When all the above said. Service is impeccable etc. But this hotel simply did not hit my expectations when it comes to the end. We stayed 5 persons for 4 days in 2 executive rooms.
"After reading all of the reviews for hotels in the city I decided to plump for Four Seasons. After all it's rare you can go wrong with a Four Seasons..... at least that's what I thought. Whilst the service is on par with some of its hotels in the group the rooms really let it down. We had booked a premiere room directly through the hotel. It was a corner room of a good size but the bathroom looked as if it had not been renovated for some thirty plus years. Unusually for Four Seasons the bath was tiny. Yes I know this is USA and baths can be small but every other FS I have stayed in they are oversized even FS New York. Bathroom products were L'Occitane and a little thin on the ground. The walk in wardrobe was deeply frustrating, not quite large enough to be a walk in and be able to accommodate suitcases and clothes. On the plus side the hotel is well located, on the flat, in the heart of the shopping district. One nice touch were all types of phone charges by the bedside phone.Would I stay here again? In short no, not unless a renovation programme gets underway, the room was too dated, in parts frustrating and the bathroom too basic. This simply does not live up to the Four Seasons brand. Oh and don't get me started on their mobile AP! I checked in on it before arriving, only to have to go through the whole rigmarole of checking in again upon arrival as apparently the AP only works if you have stayed in that particular hotel before! What a waste of time. My love affaire with Four Seasons is wavering! "
"We stayed for 4 nights in April 2017 and loved it:) The staff, check-in and check-out were great. The concierge team was fabulous, they couldn't be anymore helpful than the were! Best concierge team out of ANY place we have ever stayed. Great location, we are walkers, so we enjoyed walking down to the waterfront everyday. of course, the weather was great and we were able to explore so much of the city by foot! There was a few GREAT restaurants literally around the corner that our bellman suggested and we ate at one of those restaurants each night. Great experience all around. The concierge even arranged having a rental car brought to the hotel on our last morning so we could take it up to Sonoma. The ease of that alone was so worth it!!!!!!! Timothy especially was super awesome at the concierge station:) What worked out great is that they ha a promotion that we took advantage of and that was stay and pay 3 nights and you got the 4th night free, so worth it after comparing similar hotels in the area! LOVED it and would return there in a heartbeat. PS The highlight was the day we arrived, the NBA team The Washington Wizards were staying there so we got to see the players out and about, what a great experience."
"I was on my way to Deer Valley SLC for some spring skiing and stopped over in SF both ways on the long haul flight to and from Singapore The Four Seasons SF was the perfect stopover for me - warm and welcoming with personalised greetings for regular guests and almost seamless check in and out, a lovely bar to unwind in, on the way to the room, and access to a superb equinox gym with 20m pool a big draw for me "
"In SF for combination business/personal visit. Excellent service from the staff. Very clean rooms and common areas.The bar was comfortable for people to gather, but it was pricey. Easy walk to the Ferry Terminal to enjoy the waterfront. Had one meal at the hotel and it was well prepared."
"We really enjoyed our trip to San Francisco and staying at the Four Seasons made it even better! The rooms were clean, room service was on time, and the gym was outstanding! We will definitely stay there again if we return to San Fran!"
Room and bathroom were clean. The inconvenience of having to take two elevators every time up or down can get on your nerve. Otherwise nothing too bad or too special. Kudos to room service people though. 
"Centrally located property that falls short of Four Seasons standards, which seem to be varying greatly these days, property to property. I hadn't noticed such a wide delta between various FS hotels as I have in recent years. I expect luxury from the brand - this property gives me sanitised comfort. FS San Francisco is a good business hotel - no character. Bright, clean rooms - much like you may find at a 4 star properties. Nothing special, which is why I'm giving it 3 stars."
"This hotel was the perfect match for travelling with 2 tweenagers (11/13). Room had a great view, breakfasts were delicious (albeit a bit pricey despite the AmEx platinum breakfast credit) and the in-house health club removed any excuse for not exercising on vacation. The location had great access for sights and shopping, and only a block away from the train to the Warriors game."
"Our stay was short, but we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Four Seasons San Francisco. The staff was outstanding and welcoming. We went to a show in the afternoon and came back to the bar in the evening after dinner. It was a lovely experience overall and We will be back."
"Hotel was perfect. Quiet comfortable rooms. 4 stars is in comparison to other 4 Seasons with beautiful outdoor sitting areas and pool like in Seattle. Coffee an tea priced at $8 and $9 for breakfast is ridiculously high. Location is also perfect, around the corner from Union Square. "
"The service at this Fourseasons was fantastic. It is centrally located in an area with a lot of shopping and convenience that you can get to on foot. We enjoyed our stay, our room was clean and comfortable and staff was friendly and helpful. I especially liked the bedding and the soft pillows they offered. I would recommend this hotel and would definitely go back to this hotel. On our last day we walked out the front door and to the right and had burgers at super Duper burgers they were wonderful. Wine at the bar or a hot tea next to the fire make for very nice memories. There's also a really nice garden just a block away that you could walk to and enjoy. We were at this hotel for a wedding that was held at the four seasons and it was a five star wedding. I hope this review is helpful to someone!"
I really enjoyed my stay at Four Seasons. The staff was very courteous and willing to assist us with every need. This applied to everyone from the front desk staff to the doormen and concierge. My husband really enjoyed the wonderful gym facilities which was a bonus. The location is perfect as the hotel is within walking distance to innumerable shops and a short ride to tourist attractions. 
"I travel to the bay area every other month and this property is my home base. The location is perfect for walking to business and entertaining destinations. The views are terrific. And while the rooms may be a tad bit dated, the working space is excellent - and I do spend a fair amount of time on conference calls on eastern time. The service is flawless. Housekeeping, concierge, door and bell, front desk and room service all first class, friendly and respectful. I stayed the night of the election and asked for all papers in the morning which they happily provided. In subsequent visits, the front desk has insisted on providing two papers because they know I enjoy them!The restaurant is adequate but with so many marvelous alternatives in the neighborhood have only eaten dinner their once. I frequently see smiling families in the elevator, so don't think this is just a business hotel. "
"This hotel is two blocks from Union Square and two blocks from the Powell Street Bart Station. The hotel is very nice and has a huge gym (which is actually a Public Gym not the typical small hotel gym). The hotel will shuttle you to the nearby theaters if you make a reservation in advance which was very helpful for my husband and I. The location is great, an easy launching point to go anywhere in the city. It’s definitely busy and can sometimes seem like the tourist cyclone however I work close by when I’m in town so it’s one of my preferred locations. The staff provides a high level of service without being to stuffy and the rooms are cozy. The hotel is surrounded by shopping and restaurants which makes it easy for me to relax after a long day."
"4 star good , clean quiet comfortable it's a nice bed in a new city . Use Uber everywhere is close . The French restaurant "" Claud "" is 5 minets by foot . Close to moma . No chocolates on turn down service but you can't have it all."
"Travel agent suggested the Four Seasons in Union Square, competitive with hotels in the area. Nice spacious rooms, central location, classy but not pretentious. Make sure you get a rate with breakfast as the restaurant is pricey.Special thanks to Vanessa for the great Concierge advice and scheduling of tours and dinners. A great concierge is worth its weight in gold, saving you time and money while making great suggestions for family with teens.Also special thanks to Eric's VIP Tours for turning a rain day into a great day."
"The Four Seasons in San Francisco is a solid, high-quality hotel for the business traveller. It is conveniently located in downtown. Similar to other Four Seasons around the world, the service is excellent, but slightly lower than the service levels in top Asian cities. I did not dine in the coffee shop, but it certainly looked lively and smart. The rooms were solid too. There are other boutique hotels with character and charm which I've stayed in, but far less convenient than the Four Seasons. "
"We love staying at the Four Seasons San Francisco, it is very relaxing, a few floors up above the business of Market Street and a cozy vibe in the hotel, from the lobby to the bar, fireplace, comfortable sitting areas, and the view from the table in the restaurant. Club Equinox has a great view from a lot of their bicycles, elliptical machines. The door man greets you while opening the door for you, will stand out in the rain to get you a cab. Love this place..."
"I enjoyed my stay at the Four Seasons. The hotel was located close to shopping, food, and the BART so there was no need for me to rent a car. The hotel staff was friendly while still being professional and the service was top notch. The room was clean and the housekeeping staff did a nice job with daily service. I've read some reviews that stated the hotel is dated which I disagree with. While the hotel is not extremely modern it is nicely equipped and well maintained so I had no issues with it. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. I stayed in the premier suite, I was hoping for a better view but in all fairness you are in the middle of the city. I would definitely recommend staying here."
I travel extensively and rate youe hotel among the top 5 hotels that i have stayed in. the service was simply outstanding. the quality of furnishings and the general decor was great. the location of the hotel is also superb.
"Excellent hotel experience in terms of location. Calm environment, attentive service, quiet rooms, good lighting, impeccable cleanliness. We would not hesitate to visit hotel in the future as we felt very much at home here. Superior to other Four Seasons we have visited in Hawaii, Denver, and Beverly Hills (where we returned after dinner to find the maid had left the entry door to our suite held opened with the deadbolt, but never returned)."
"I booked this hotel just because I always happy with four seasons hotel , but in San Francisco it's nothing special , room definitely looks like 3-4 stars hotel . Location is perfect . For that money I can stay in cross of street the same conditions hotel, just different name lol"
"We came here on our honeymoon and the hotel prepared a nice little romantic set up for us. Hotel was clean, new, and in perfect condition. In a nice location. Next to the Westfield Mall, the shopping area, and the subway. Exceptional service. The doormen were helpful in getting us cabs."
"Not only is the Four Seasons up to the party you'd expect, but the breakfast was superlative. You can order from the menu or customize your order... both perfect. Thev service was excellent. Coffee just right. And all in a beautiful space looking up Market Street to Twin Peaks. Nice surprise for one of the gives the hotels in the City."
Excellent choice due to its location and extremely professional concierge team. I feel the rooms are a bit blah though they are well maintained. Breakfast is excellent and so is the arrival service. We rented a car through the concierge and it was incredibly smooth. Mattresses too soft but that is a matter of personal taste. 
"Six day base camp for west coast college tours. Hotel could not have been more friendly and responsive to our needs. Spacious room, great views, fourth night free package. The room was refreshed twice a day and was always spotless. They even folded the clothes we left on chairs. Nice treats in the afternoon and plenty of bedside waters provided complimentary for evening hydration. Location can't be beat for safe exploration of shopping and dining options, and the staff is thoughtful and unpretentious but unfailingly professional as well. Can't imagine getting better service elsewhere. Our only choice in San Francisco."
"location, location, location... was the best part of this place... you can walk to almost anywhere if your 10yr old is willing... you just have to promise a stop at Ghirardelli (2blocks down the street) great uphill walk to china town and then to ""stinking rose""or concierge can help book reservations at a place of your choice like E&O or Yang Sing just to name a few of my fav spots when I'm out there :)"
"Prime location & worth every penny to be in safe area & walking distance to all! Steps out of front door takes you to shopping mayhem, local coffee shops, eateries and cable cars to tour the city. Room decor outdated but excellent city views. Travelled with a friend so opted for 2 beds... who knew the bed sizes were twins? The beds and cost of hotel coffee were my only dislike. Spa treatments were definitely on the higher scale but service was above par @ Equinox. Room service portions were overpriced and below expectations. Last day I ordered coffee and never was delivered! (Ended up getting free pot of coffee an hour later) Spend your $ and time in the fun city to get better bang for your buck! "
"Overall very nice hotel, the added benefit was a central location with some amazing restaurants nearby. Alittle disappointed with in-house restaurant, it's speciality was fish but did an average job preparing by over cooling "
Very much enjoy staying at the Four Seasons. Perfect service on my room stay and delicious in-room breakfast. The beds are so comfortable and quiet too. And I love the soaps and shampoos. It's a welcome oasis in a bustling town.
"The hotel rooms are showing their age a little, especially compared to other high end options in SF like the St. Regis. Service is impeccable as always at Four Seasons. The bar and restaurant are modern and really nice. Location is central for most business and retail needs in San Francisco, although there is the usual abundance of homeless people in the immediate vicinity."
Our experience in staying at the Four Seasons 3/3/17 was everything Four Seasons is about. I checked in on the mobile app which was very convenient. I stopped at the front desk to pick up our keys and the gentleman realized a room on a higher floor would be better since my 10 yr old daughter was with us for less noise from the street. Upon giving her a stuffed animal of her choice she was happy as a princess. The room was amazing with an amazing view and every interaction with the staff at the hotel was friendly and helpful. The bellman at this hotel are phenomenal. How they work your needs from the front entrance to the valet in the back is awesome and so helpful! Thank you to them for everything! Our weekend stay was amazing and we will definitely be back!
Fantastic hotel! It's comfortable and luxurious at the same time. I love the keys that pave the path to the parking entrance. It is all the little details that make this hotel great. They also have the greatest pens!! Look forward to my next stay!
"Public spaces are beautiful but room seemed tired and in need of some maintenance. Restaurant looks great, but food was so-so and definitely not worth the price. Heard some noise from Market Street even on the 9th floor. Service was excellent despite above reservations."
For the money $435 USD plus taxes and still charged us $16 USD for 2 coffee on the way out for a walk in the morning and on top of it we had to ask for a Coffe machine in our room for a hotel this dynamic we are very disappointed!
"The service, rooms, and dining are always great. Most importantly there is a warm welcoming experience. Location is right next to SF MOMA and Contemporary Jewish Museum, within walking distance to great dining, shopping, trolley snd ferry building. Great concierge."
"This was a special weekend for my wife and I and our stay at the Four Seasons in SFO could not have been better. The location is very central and the hotel is spectacular, the service and in particular room service was perfect. We ordered in room dining every morning and this was better that going to the restaurant as it was like having our own personal restaurant in the room."
"An upscale, 5 star luxury hotel and we ""splurged"" to stay there ($450 per night ++). Room, staff, ambiance are all top notch…. except…… wait for it …. no coffee maker in the room!! I know I could order room service coffee in the morning ($30+), but I just want coffee when I want coffee and I don't want to wait for it or pay for room service every morning. Having said that, coffee is available for free in the morning --- at the bar --- but that means a trip to get it. Ugh. The coffee is wonderful by the way.Meals in the restaurant are lovely but very $$$$. Centrally located and an easy walk to the BART Powell Station."
"Excellent location with easy access to public transport and easy walking distance to most areas. Very comfortable and well appointed hotel. The beds were great. The service from the staff was fantastic and rooms very clean. Perfectly located for shopping and some very good local restaurants (ask the concierge, they're very helpful suggesting appropriate restaurants that suit your needs)."
"We enjoyed our little getaway to San Francisco. The staff, room and room service were wonderful. Great location, within walking distance to Union Square, Chinatown, Westfield Mall and the Embarcadero."
In a wonderful location location and with a great sense of quiet luxury. Steps away from Union Square and all the best shopping. Going back for my Birthday in March. Also use the Four Seasons as a starting point for a night or two when meeting friends on our way to Napa Valley. JB
"As one would expect from a Four Seasons, this hotel is beautiful and the service is great! When I first arrived I was greeted by a very nice Bellman who directed me to the lobby upstairs for check-in, in turn the the gentleman at check-in was welcoming and enjoyable to talk with as well... I suspect that I was given a complimentary upgrade given my room was huge and resembled that of a corner junior suite, however I was not told of an upgrade so that was a nice surprise when I got into the actual room. The room itself was nice, the view was great, and the bed was comfortable. Room service was fantastic as was the turn down service as well. Maids never moved my stuff, like many hotel maids do, however they did organize it nicely so that my room was very clean and organized every day! My sunglasses were always set on a Four Seasons glasses shammy they provided and my dopp kit and toiletries were always nicely placed on a small mat they provided on the counter in the bathroom. The only negative when staying at this hotel is in ordering Ubers; given where the hotel is located and odd traffic laws in San Fran many of the Uber drivers got confused and lost when trying to pick me up. I suggest checking with the hotel staff before ordering! The hotel does have a car service but because its first come first serve it is often unavailable."
"after a difficult flight the staff welcome and service from the desk checkin to the servers in the bar/food area reduced the stress and allowed me to to to my meetings with ease instead of tension.As usual the room was ready even arriving before official check in time. Breakfast was delivered on time and all the food was hot, so a great start before leaving for a long day of meetings."
"Luxury rooms, with a bed you do not want to get out of. Superior service and comfort you would expect at a Four Seasons. Treating ourselves to celebrate our anniversary and very glad we did. Love the bathroom and fancy robe the best."
"The Four Seasons is a luxurious hotel which happened to offer a 4 nights for 3 special while we were traveling to a convention in San Francisco. Even with that special offer, it still came up to be more than we expected because the nightly tax is horrendous. The rooms are perfect, the sleep is sound, the staff is among the best trained in the country to cater to demanding rich people. Free shoe polishing and free newspaper every morning."
"This rating is for Four Seasons Standards, for any other hotel it would be a Five. The corner room we had was excellent, fantastic views, the restaurant was excellent with great service, there was something about the ambience of the hotel, it lacked a little of the grandeur of many Four Seasons, the lobby is on floor 5 and ground entrance is at the back."
"Multiple stays over the years. Fantastic every time in every respect.Highly recommend FS San Francisco for both their service and location. have traveled for business and pleasure, Perfect every time."
"Stayed in a one bedroom suite with my daughter for 5 days. Wonderful and spacious suite giving my daughter and I our own space. The services at the restaurant, room service, laundries, and housekeeping were all impeccable giving me a peace of mind to relax and enjoy our stay in San Francisco."
"hotel is very close to the convention center, union square, market street, shopping areas like barneys and neiman marcus, and to the westfield shopping centers. Lobby is at the 5th floor. Doormen are friendly, as well as the housekeeping employees. Only one restaurant outlet, though, and food choices are not as diverse. Fitness center and use of Equinox is top-notch."
"I'm a loyal fan of Four Seasons properties because they have always exceed my expectations. This San Francisco property is perfectly situated-just blocks from fabulous shopping, iconic restaurants, and the SFMoMA. Also, just an elevator ride away, is an Equinox Sports Club, which is undergoing a 2-year phased renovation, while carefully leaving spacious fitness equipment areas, 25-yard indoor pool, and group fitness classes. Early risers coffee bar is impressive, complete with mini muffins and a cappuccino machine. Depending upon your room, the views can be unsurpassed. But the best part of staying with Four Seasons is always the service. From the front desk team who catered to my special requests to the staff and management of MKT Restaurant making every small accommodation to my order, to Housekeeping (requested scissors in my hands in 5 minutes) and the valets who called our driver while en route to the airport to make sure we were headed to the correct location, Amazing!"
"We really LOVE Four Seasons Hotels. Typically the service is 5 - Star and the amenities are amazing! We came to SF for a Golden State Warriors Game with our 11 year old son. He is also a BIG fan of Four Seasons. Needless to say, we had high expectations for Four Seasons Hotel San Francisco based on previous Four Seasons experiences. Sadly we were let down . . . first and foremost let me just say this Four should have a warning on the website: Kids Tolerated. Pool is for 16 and older, lap swimming only. We were all but accosted at the spa/work out area - we just wanted to check out the amenities but we were not allowed to move pass the desk if our son was with us. At every other Four we have taken our son he has been treated like a King. My heart was broken when my son looked at me and said ""It kind of feels like they don't want me here."" The location of this hotel is awesome and the views are amazing but keep looking if you have a child traveling with you . . ."
"You can never go wrong with staying at the Four Seasons. As being our preferred hotel in any city we go to, we came in expecting great service and great service is what we got, and more. From the moment we drove into the private entrance the staff made every effort to accommodating us and making us feel at home. We booked an Executive Suite and the first room we were given, I was not satisfied with the view, so we were immediately moved to a higher floor with an amazing view of the city and water. The room was very large and nicely decorated.Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was great. Breakfast choices were great and the waiters always remembered our preferred drinks every morning. Whenever we walked in and out of the hotel, we were greeted by name and smiles. Always a big plus. Our 4 night stay at the hotel was great and we can't wait to be back and travel to other Four Seasons around the world."
Room service was horrible had to wait 30 minutes for the luggage to be brought up to our room. We did call for the TV to be repaired and the guy came within 10 minutes and was very nice and fixed it but that added onto my having to wait in the room while my family was down having drinks and hors d'oeuvres 
"We really enjoyed our stay at the 4 Seasons...service was great and they even gave us a wonderful birthday surprise!! (delicious dessert).Unfortunately, breakfast at the restaurant was overpriced and my sausage was undercooked!! After giving me the wrong sausage, they tried to expedite the new one and undercooked it. Boy, did I feel the wrath of that one the entire next day!Overall - The hotel service was great & the rooms were clean/well-maintained. Just don't eat at the restaurant!"
"Just another enjoyable, problem free stay at the Four Seasons Hotel in San Francisco.. Great atmosphere, convenient location, super staff and facilities..Did the ""Bed and Breakfast"" - great value.. and the breakfast menu has it all.Also the Lobby Bar is a great place to have a drink and meet some interesting people."
Thank you for a wonderful time. The atmosphere is most welcoming. Just passing by the lobby and we were informed of some great activities and sights to see and places to eat. Have to mention Al's suggestions for dinner was splendid along with a quick stroll to build up an appetite.
"The hotel knows great service. From the restaurant to the bell hop to the concierge, the staff ensures you are taken care of.I have to give it a 3-star because although the lobby and restaurant are nice, the rooms need updating. We have stayed in hotels all over the world, but the rooms we saw here were mediocre at best. At a $450+ price tag per night, you would expect a hotel to keep their rooms fresh and elegant. We ended up staying elsewhere, but almost stayed for the service alone. So keep up the great work! (But please renovate/re-imagine those rooms too!)"
"Upon arrival I get my keys and check into my room. When entering the room I noticed a foul odor. I set my bags down and look around the room to see where it could be coming from. The first thing I noticed were wet spots on the chair. Then I realized that the carpets were also severely stained. The bellman had even mentioned there was a foul odor and offered to get my room changed. I get assigned a new room and the towels had strings hanging off of them, The sheets were dirty, and the TV had a poor signal. I had mentioned it was my birthday and they did nothing to acknowledge it. Valet had taken so long with my car I almost missed my Birthday dinner. Horrible stay, Dirty rooms, and poorly managed. The manager called me making a ton of excuses on why they messed up. He wasn't even apologetic. What ever you do don't stay here."
As always its the people that make four seasons special and the visit to San Fran confirmed that opinion again great staff make a great hotel. Always helpful always listening even to crazy people like me
"Despite the hotel being completely booked due to the JP Morgan Health Conference being in town, service remained impeccable. Hotel has a very central location, and is walking distance from the downtown core. Rooms are spacious, staff are wonderful. And elevator access to the 110,000 square foot Equinox is a big bonus, particularly when the weather is cold and rainy."
"Every employee I interacted with was simply amazing. From the front desk at check-in, to the valet, concierge and dining staff. An amazing stay and the best welcome to the New Year ever! I'm SO glad that we chose to stay at this property. It was the best Four Seasons hotel yet."
"Check in problems: my reseervation could not be found.Poblem with a stray rollaway charge on my final bill meant more aggravation than I am used to. That said, both issues were resolved, the first after ~15 minutes the second after ~24 hours."
"Rooms could stand to be refurbished, but they were clean and pleasant. All things considered, I wouldn't have wanted to stay anywhere else. Everyone we encountered at the hotel was very helpful and warm. "
"We stayed at the FS in SFO a number of years ago. While it was fine, it was not particularly noteworthy. On this occasion, we found that the hotel was top notch. The common areas were beautiful and the quality of the rooms were befitting a high end hotel. The Concierge was excellent in assisting us in our visit to Berkeley and to find suitable restaurants around the hotel. You would not expect the Four Seasons to be inexpensive - but what you want is that they deliver the goods for the price being charged. On this visit they did just that. We would happily return."
This is an nice hotel and myself and my girlfriend thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The room was nice and spacious and gets cleaned twice a day. The staff are extremely helpful and courteous. The gym and pool areas are absolutely superb. The only negative is that for the price I paid for the five nights that no breakfast was included.
"FS San Fran is probably our favorite FS, second to only Maui. It's close to shopping and decent food - do beware though, a few blocks up is a rough area. If you're coming for the touristy things you'll have quite the walk, or a cab ride. The rooms are nice, room service is good, and the staff are awesome. Courtney in concierge is a rock star, bar tender Erin is awesome, and Chris and Bobby (two of the doormen) are standouts as well. I imagine sometime in the next few years the hotel will get a face lift, but for now it's still a gem in the middle of a bustling city. Thanks again for a great stay!"
"Well located property with built in window seat, luxurious bath and twice daily service. Market Street is busy which created some noise but also provided easy access to other parts of the city. Very convenient for SF MOMA. We did encournter many homeless people but unfortunatly that was something we experienced throughout the city. Limited menu at hotel restaurant but lovely decor and again, outstanding guest service."
"We were warned the property was getting tired and would be renovated in the near future. We did not feel it one bit. Rooms were perfect, service top notch, and the Equinox gym is great. We experienced what would one would expect from a Four Seasons."
"First, the Four Seasons is on Market Street, which seems to be ground zero for every crackhead and aggressive homeless person west of the Mississippi. The location alone is reason to never stay here but we were at least hoping for an oasis inside this horrible neighborhood. We are disappointed. The hotel has a weird / annoying double elevator situation where you are forced to take an elevator to the lobby on the 5th floor and then another elevator to the hotel floors. Second, for the money we are paying, which is well over $600/night, I expect a bit more. There's ONE restaurant here - and it seems nice but the lobby area seems sterile and uninviting. The room itself lacks modern amenities such as power outlets in places where you want them (e.g. next to the bed). In fact, the bed situation is strange in that there is only one nightstand and one light - on one side of the bed. That's fine - but what about the person on the other side of the bed???? Weird. The TV system is old and dated - taking forever to flip between channels and the TV Guide and the wifi is just okay. I stayed at a hotel in Napa for 3 days before this that blew the Four Seasons away in terms of comfort, attentiveness to guests, wifi, TVs, lobby, and bedding. And for less than half the price. The gym, Equinox, is outstanding and might be the only positive I can muster for this very old hotel that needs serious updating."
This is a super hotel in SF for work or family - I have stayed here for both but my last two trips have been great. The rooms are clean and nice as expected. The staff is nice and services are prompt. The room service is healthy and exceptionally good. The bar and seating areas are excellent to meet friends or associates. The location is excellent and central and this is my goto in SF.
"Living in Sonoma, it was such a pleasure to be able to pop into the city for the night and stay somewhere so local to everywhere we needed to be. The team at the property is most gracious and our entire experience was stellar!"
Excellent location....but the real difference was the excellent service from all staff. Special shout out to Front Desk Manager James Mizuka who went out of his way to ensure we had interconnecting rooms as we were travelling with our 2 young children.Would definitely return.
"Being a Elite members of the Four Seasons Hoteles we must say that this venue lets much to be desired. Although location is very good right at Market Street. Hotel lacks personality, ambiance. Decor is old and somehow outdated. Our suite quite expensive is well below the FS standard. As a mean of comparison for the same price you will get a fantastic suite bigger and nicely decorated at the George V member of the sme group. The FSSF needs a majorrenivation."

All staff was incredible from front desk to bellmen to maids. Bed was ridiculously comfortable. Room was beautiful. The hotel went above and beyond for us (we were celebrating a special occasion). Absolutely went that extra mile which we appreciated very much!
"This has always been a go-to-spot for client dinners and drinks. Finally, I had had enough of other hotels in the city and decided it was time. The check-in process was efficient, quick, and my room was ready early as requested. I was concerned being on the Market St side, when I got to my room - as I know it is very loud, but the room was VERY quite. I fact, it was perfect...everything about it. From the concierge, to the staff and food at MKT - all amazing. Looking forward to my next return, in the spring. "
Great hotel. All service people went out of their way to make you feel welcome. Also enjoyed the restaurant. Great food and service was excellent. Compares favorably with other luxury hotels in SF. Highly recommend.
"Every time I travel to San Francisco, the Four Seasons is always my choice. It's standards are exemplary. The comfort is next level and the staff are beyond helpful. The attention to detail and quality is such amazing value for money."
"My fourth stay in the last five years, same tired room carpeting but a new dimension has been added....the food went from outstanding to average. The caption for this Review speaks for itself. Perhaps one may desire to have your staff clean behind the bar, bartenders and staff walking over popcorn and overflowing trash containers has very little eye appeal for your guests. "
"great location, nice check in and housekeepers but the rooms are so worn and tired. you hear that in several reviews and they are right. carpet needs to be replaced, sheets are old and rough towel washed way to many times. someone is not watching the store. also the bar downstairs has the rudest bartenteres that seemed over worked and did not want to be there."
"My wife and I recently stayed at the Four Seasons Hotel in San Francisco. The construction quality of this hotel is superb. The interior design, furnishings and gym are thoughtful, tasteful and exceed expectations. The hotel's downtown location is excellent, as it is just steps away from shops, galleries and museums. This is an amazing hotel!"
"We felt taken care of from the minute that we arrived. All staff from valet to front desk and concierge were amazing. Great location too, just 1-2 blocks from major shopping areas, conv center and many restaurants."
"I stay in hotels over 200 nights/year. The Four Seasons is my go to brand, unless there is a Mandarin Oriental. I have many favorite Four Seasons properties - unfortunately SF is not one of them. The positive? The best rooms in the city I think. And good food, room service and restaurant. The negative? No views. In over 50 nights in the last few years, not one person knows my name, even tho I know theirs. they have turned their lobby into a workplace for non guests, and added computer tables as a meeting space for non guests. Perhaps good for business, but certainly not my style - it keeps it loud and impersonal. Their spa? Equinox gym. Perhaps a better gym than most hotels, but the worst spa of any four seasons I've ever visited. Dying for the Langham to open in SF!"
"Once again, four seasons doesn't disappoint. Excellent location, outstanding service ...I do mean outstanding. From the front desk to concierge to the laundry service. The concierge booked a private wine tour for my group that was outstanding, and I've done a ton of these.!Restaurant recommendations and reservations (which are difficult to obtain in San Fran) were terrific.The laundry service even gave me a little flower with my dry cleaning . It's the little touches!The lobby bar is great. How the server remembered our individual drink orders the following night wAs beyond us! Again.. the little touches.Restaurant is casual and great breakfast , and best lunch we had anywhere in San Fran!We will return for certain "
"This hotel is really great. Located on Market Street, at the center of the city, the noise of the Street is completely isolated so we had a noise-free week albeit at the center of it all. The concierge was great and so were the people at reception. The lobby is a wide open space now greatly decorated for the end of year season. Had we designed it for ourselves we could not have done it better."
"From 7:30 A.M. when they let us check in early so we could attend an early meeting, to check out, every part of our stay was excellent. We were warmly greeted back into the hotel every time we returned. All the staff were pleasant and would greet us as we walked past them. Check out was as easy as pressing a button on the phone. It could not get much better."
"Stayed three nights recently in an Executive Suite in this downtown SF property. Room was quite spacious, though sparsely furnished, with aging, unremarkable décor. In-room technology was unimpressive – on demand movies and on-screen folio review functions did not seem to work properly. Bed was comfortable, though the hotel suffers from fairly noisy HVAC and plumbing systems. Service was generally prompt and courteous in the usual Four Seasons fashion, though housekeeping didn’t show up until after 3:30pm one day. Best hotel feature is its unbeatable location – a short walk to Union Square, Westfield Shopping along Market Street, and the SF Financial District, as well as convenient subway access. Food and service in the onsite MKT Restaurant is also a real plus."
"Returned for another stay at the Four Seasons San Francisco. It is truly a wonderful hotel. The hotel environment is stunning! From the moment you enter the hotel every staff member treats you so special! We love coming back to this hotel and experiencing the amazing service they provide to all their guests.Billy the bell hop brought us to our room and was so pleasant and helpful.We stayed in an Executive Suite which is so spacious with beautiful décor. The bed is the most comfortable we have ever experienced with luxurious linens. The housekeeping staff is so accommodating to any request we had. Thank you Jody for always taking care of us!All the waiters in the MKT restaurant provide excellent service. Special thanks to Joel, Marcos, Abimaen , Jie and Evelyn for waiting on us and remembering us from our past visits.We loved seeing Sean again who greeted us with a big hug! You are an amazing person!The MKT Host Stand including Ivan and Jackie are great.We had breakfast every morning in MKT restaurant with a large menu with delicious food and beautiful presentations. They also provide complimentary newspapers.We had a Fabulous Thanksgiving Dinner at MKT with our family. Thank you Alex D'Addio the Assistant Food and Beverage Manager who handled our reservations.Rafael waited on us for our dinner and he is a great waiter and was so accommodating to our family.There is also a great bar that is the place to be! We love the great shopping right outside the hotel.A big thanks to Chiko for making our stay so amazing and wonderful. Four Seasons is very lucky to have you!As you see we love everything about this hotel! That is why we always come back and it is the only hotel we will stay at in San Francisco.Four Seasons San Francisco is a Class Act! The Best Service, Wonderful Accommodations, Great Food and the Most Fabulous Staff!We can't wait to come back! Thank you for always making us feel like royalty!This is the Absolute Finest Hotel in San Francisco!"
"We simply adore the Four Seasons everything about their customer service to their luxurious beds, but this property is TIRED and is in bad need of a renovation. They mentioned a renovation is imminent. Likewise the Equinox attached is about to undergo a massive renovation so WAIT and I am sure it will be worth it. The staff was wonderful and they were able to accommodate our requests and generously upgraded us to a suite and sent up prosecco and strawberries for our30th anniversary and disappointment."
"Great room, great people, awesome amenities. Staff actually greet you by your name. The General Manager Doug was fantastic in helping any issues I had! Room service food was great, along with service. Location was right in the heart of the city!"
"Spacious, well-appointed room. Surprisingly quiet since it fronted on Market, a very busy street. The MKT Restaurant served an first rate, although pricey, breakfast. The location allowed easy walking to the SoMa area, Yerba Buena, Union Square and Chinatown. It had the best hotel room lighting for reading."
The hotel is in a great location with nice rooms. My wife and I stayed in a small suite that was spacious and comfortable. Dinner in the property was nice and the next day the front desk suggested a wonderful local restaurant for lunch. The personalized service and attention to detail are well worth the price.
"Only location was good, but don't expect to see four seasons standers in this hotel. not like Europe Four seasons. here the name not as u know sorry to say that. even resturant forks not clean had lipstick on it"
"It shall come as no surprise that the Four Seasons Hotel San Francisco is outstanding in every way. I slept, dined, and attended a business conference here and it was first class from top to bottom. You will see from my other reviews that I have had the opportunity to stay at Four Seasons, Ritz Carltons and many other top hotels throughout the world and this one ranks amount the best. In the spirit of full disclosure the view from MY room was not the best (but okay) and the location on Market Street is not as good as the Ritz Carlton in the Nob Hill neighborhood, but it is still every bit the five star hotel on the inside.If you have the means this place is worth every penny!"
Proverbial home run. Everything you want nothing you don't want in a luxury property.On this trip they renovated the new Cut bar. Looks great with warm vibe. Terrific food from Wolfgang Puck's Cut restaurant served at the bar. Moonier the bar tender is a Rock Star. But so is the rest of the team at the hotel. Maid service to management; all first class folks.
"What I've come to expect from The Four Seasons, quality through and through. Whether in this country or across the glob, the Four Seasons always delivers a welcoming ""Glad you're back."" feel. Thank you!"
"Great room, comfortable, quiet, great friendly staff. Definitely will return. Only complaint was not enough towels and bath product provided for a 5-star hotel. Room service was the best. Enjoyed the look and feel of the bar and lounge."
"Grabbed a great deal on hotels.com for a great nightly price averaging $333. Worth every penny and more. From arriving and being greeted, to them finding a room to check in early (10:30am), to an amazing room and the great amenities in it. My wife and I enjoyed coming and going and the luxurious feel of the entire stay.BEST PART: 1st night we came back to our room to chocolate covered strawberries and champagne as part of turn down service!!!Great location allowing to get to all great San Francisco sites. "
"The deluxe-view king room felt spacious with its bench seating in the enormous windows. While the tub was nothing special, the bathroom featured a large separate shower, a door to the water closet and bright lighting. All appliances and surfaces in the bath area were immaculately clean. The hallways presented a soft and whisper-quiet environment.Mattress, pillows, linens were luxurious and comfortable -- perfect, really.Hotel staff gets the highest marks -- all were attentive, pleasant and very efficient.IMPORTANT: If you are driving and are planning to use a GPS or smartphone for navigation, 217 Stevenson St (at Third St) is the correct entry for your device. Do NOT use the Market St address. A couple of pics have been added to illustrate the view of the signage at Third Street as well as the Stevenson St entrance for valet, parking and the bellman.It was sad that our San Francisco experience was significantly diminished by the numerous and occasionally aggressive street bums. If we ever do return for vacation again, we'd happily consider staying at Four Seasons."
"Our experience inside the hotel was fantastic , Great location, nice hotel The location on Market St is excellent - within a 45 to 60 minute walk to most everything in San Francisco. The rooms are nice and clean - the hotel is clean - and the staff is very helpful."
"For the price the rooms could be bigger, but the phenomenal view I had made up for that. The staff is very helpful and accommodating. I wish I could afford to stay in a hotel like this more often. I was only there 2 days and didn't really get a chance to use the pool or the gym or the spa."
Our experience inside the hotel was fantastic however on the street outside of the hotel ruined the overall experience due to the unpleasant characters that constantly approached my wife and I. One was quite aggressive and stole my coffee while we sat in front of Peets. He was very threatening when I confronted him. For this reason we will not be returning to San Francisco.
"Great location, nice hotel but a notch under what one expects from a Four Seasons. The layout is awkward - you either enter in a taxi through an alley or walk in from Market Street - from either entry you have to take an elevator to the ""lobby"" on the 5th floor..........and then proceed to another elevator to your room. Not a great system especially for security purposes - once you are in the building you do not even walk by the front desk to get to the elevators to the rooms. The location on Market St is excellent - within a 45 to 60 minute walk to most everything in San Francisco. The rooms are nice and clean - the hotel is clean - and the staff is very helpful."
"The front desk staff was outstanding in every detail. Initial reservation was booked by Mr. Alex Warren who did an absolutely outstanding job. He was personable, efficient, courteous and completely thorough with every step in the process. I could not be happier with the entire experience. Looking forward to spending more time at any Four Seasons! Outstanding in every detail."
"We started our vacation in San Francisco, arriving early one morning. We very easily checked in, even though we were 5 hours earlier than the normal check-in time. The room was great and every interaction we had with the staff, from the room attendants to the concierge to the doormen to the front desk was excellent. The location was perfect to get anywhere in San Francisco, whether walking, ubering, getting a cab or taking the street cars."
"This is everything you would expect from a Four Seasons hotel. Great room with City view and even opening window! Hotel is a little strange as it takes one elevator to get from Street level to reception and another to reach your room - not so convenient. Staff were superb, always remembering who we were and very efficient and courteous.If you take you car - beware that you go to the rear entrance not the main address. I went to the main address which seems to be common, and after receiving directions it took me 40 minutes in traffic to travel less than one block to Valet parking."
"We stayed for four nights in late October and would definitely return for our next trip to San Francisco. The location is perfect for getting around. The staff throughout the hotel---from the front desk to the cleaning staff to the restautart---all went out of their way to make our stay pleasant. The room was clean and comfortable, with a clear view of the water. We ate breakfast at the restaurant each morning which was fresh and well prepared (although I would have preferred a breakfast buffet as one finds in most hotels). We also had drinks at the very attractive bar. A real plus of staying here is access to the attached Equinox gym which far exceeds what one normally finds in a hotel. I have stayed at several other comparable hotels in San Francisco, and find this one the best."
"Spent 4 nights here in a deluxe room in late October 2016. The location is perfect and the room was spacious and bright. I loved the window seat that ran the span of the room. Housekeeping and turn-down were wonderful. I also loved the iced tea and infused water available in the lobby, after a long day of conferencing or sightseeing. The rest of the service at the hotel was good but not as helpful as other Four Seasons properties I have stayed at, but by no means was it a negative experience overall. There was some inattention to details and aloofness that made me feel a bit under-appreciated. For example, trying to get a taxi on a rainy night was difficult and the doormen weren't helpful until I involved the concierge. First the doormen said it would be very hard to get a cab and suggested I walk down to an intersection to try to hail one myself. So I tried that but after standing outside in the rain for 10 minutes and having no luck, I headed back to the hotel and asked the doormen to help me. They suggested UBER but since I don't have it on my phone, they recommended I go back to my room and download and set it up in order to get where I needed to go. That seemed like a huge hassle, so I went back up to the concierge and politely but incredulously asked how a person is supposed to get around the city at night. Their response was that the doormen would absolutely get me a cab. So I went back down and the doormen sprung into action and got me a cab within about 5 minutes. I am not sure why that couldn't have happened in the first place. The quality of the hotel was good but not extraordinary. I don't understand why they don't have Nespresso/coffee machines in the rooms. There was a cabinet by the door which had snacks on the top (to be paid for of course) and the doors below were locked. Why locked I wondered? What was in there that I wasn't allowed to see? Also, I know California is in drought, but why is there no water-pressure setting on the shower? The shower pressure was actually painful. Thinking about it still makes me cringe. I ordered room service each morning which was fast and decent but the coffee was lacking every day. Too strong and not very fresh. For a hotel of this size and calibre, fresh coffee should be an easy detail. I was thrilled with most aspects of my stay but in the end, I don't think I'll be back to this hotel because the little details took away from the experience. "
"This hotel is in a great location -- easy walking distance to many places around the city. I arrived late at night after a 4-hour flight and appreciated the quick check in process. I stayed in room 603, which I believe is a standard King. The best thing about this room is that it was quiet and comfortably large. The least appealing aspect of the room was that even though it had windows on two sides, it felt like being in a fishbowl and as though people could quite easily see into the room -- as a result, the curtains stayed closed. Nothing at all was wrong with the hotel, but nothing was particularly special either."
"Stayed for a long weekend in October. Stayed on the 17th floor, had a great view, enjoyed breakfast with my family and got great service. We drove from Palo Alto and share the parking address is not the same as the hotel address (which is on Market). You can waste a lot of time trying to get on Market.. if you drive the address to park your car is: 217 Stevenson St.Since it is in a very busy part of the city, I would recommend staying in the higher rooms; the view is better and it is much quieter.We also really appreciated talking to the Concierge before arriving as he (Erik) gave us a very comprehensive and insightful list of things to do with our daughter along with recommendations for restaurants, as there are a lot of choices so this was valuable for us.I would also note this hotel has a good pool but do not welcome children."
"It is in the upper end of room rates, but you get the appropriate experience, trust me! I got a great deal on Expedia which allowed me one of the best hotel experiences ever. Huge room with king bed and picture wind with great downtown view. Bathroom with separate shower and bath, toilet in separate room off the bathroom, classy privacy! Complimentary shoe shine was done quickly. Dry cleaning service equally as efficient. This sums up their attention to detail: I left my door open slightly as my colleague was going to be stopping in on the way out of the hotel. Within minutes security called me saying they noticed the door was open and was I OK. Very professional, as are the concierge , front desk and bellmen. All are helpful and take your experience at the hotel to heart. Beautiful outdoor patio which was great for cigars. Overall feeling and decor is very classy and elegant."
Great location in the center of everything with that great Four Seasons service. The bar was lively and the drinks and food delicious. The concierge was very helpful with dinner options and set up my reservations. The rooms have very large windows with a full cushioned window seat that was nice to utilize with my morning coffee and paper.
"Enjoyed a one-bedroom suite over a weekend. We wanted to revisit a 14th floor corner junior suite from years past, but now way over our price point. Nice view over neighborhood. Now that the area has been ""gentrified"" with blocks of many up-scale shops, walking Market Street is a pleasure. Not like old days. Still too many homeless wanderers, however.Great room service. We wanted to use refrigerator for unused guacamole and our own champagne. A waiter was sent to empty it of for-sale items, making room for our own items. We avoided high cost of hotel breakfast by walking a half-block to a small cafe."
Pricy but perfect- as you'd expect from the four seasons. I had a huge room (702) with excellent service from each and every staff member I felt with. Only had bar snacks to eat. Good but weak presentation for the price. I recommend this property. 
"I stayed here for business. I was assigned to a corner room on the14th floor with a panoramic view on the 14th floor. There is complimentary daily shoe shining service. Overall, nice and clean hotel at a good location."
"had stayed at this hotel about one year ago and returned because I loved the room and I was presenting to a client that has an office in the Tiffany building across from Union Square, which is close to this hotel. I reserved a suite so I could present to my potential client in a lovely, quiet and private setting. The living area in the suite loses off, so it was perfect. My plan was to come up the day before so I could set up the room and my audio video presentation, in a relaxed manner. It turns out our company (we are a PR firm) had a massive issue to deal with the day before, so I could not leave until the check-in date. PLUS, I ended up working until 4 am the day of check in. I was driving from LA to San Francisco because I needed to transport my fragile presentation materials. I left at 5:30 AM (on zero sleep) to make to San Francisco in time to check in and set up my presentation (2 pm). I called the hotel to let them know what I was dealing with. I had already arranged a late check out because I knew that I had to do a ton of work check out morning, before heading back to LA. Not only did they accommodate my late check out, they were very sympathetic to my situation and managed to accommodate getting me into my suite before normal check in time when the hotel was sold out! I always hate to ask for these kind of exceptions, but I really had no choice.During set up I realized I needed an extension cord for my presentation equipment. With so little time until my presentation, I had no time to run out to get one. Fortunately the hotel has on-site audio video technicians, whose i called and were up to my room in a snap. My compliments to Ian, who brought me the cord and helped me do my set up (which I was nervous about because I normally have people doing that kind of thing for me). After the presentation I attended an event at the client's office for 2 hours. On the way back to the hotel, the Uber I was in got into an accident. I arrived back to my room beyond exhausted, but very happy because we landed the account - in small part thanks to the hotel. Had things messed up with the hotel, I would have been out-of-sorts during the presentation and would have made a bad impression. Thus the outcome could have been less than desirable. As I opened my hotel room door I was touched to see a lovely cheese platter, bottle of Evian water and a fabulous bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon - along with a lovely note from the hotel General Manager! I literally had not eaten all day and I was on the verge of hallucinating from the fatigue and lack of food, so I can't tell you what a welcomed sight this sweet gift was and how much I enjoyed it.Thank you to Chad and NaNa at the front desk for doing their part to get me into my suite early. To Gita for being so understanding, accommodating and professional during her efforts to quarterback the situation and last (but not least) to Mr. Housley for doing such a great job managing the hotel, and for his kind and generous complimentary food and beverage package that included a personal note from him.I'll be returning to San Francisco monthly to meet with our new client. Needless to say, I will ONLY be staying at Four Season's San Francisco."
"Great quick get way. Nice location, very convenient and close to pretty much everything. walk distances from museum, restaurants, shops. the front desk was very welcoming and nice. the room itself wasn't very big but had an amazing view of the city and we enjoyed very much. Room service menu could use a little improvement and food was ok."
"I must admit this was only my second time staying at a Four Seasons. My first was in Whistler, BC so the bar was set quite high. Upon entering the check in area, there was a lot of trash on the floor and on the bar where infused water was being offered. Empty used water glasses and wrappers were scattered all around. Additionally, the desks of the check in workers were very cluttered. Definitely something Management needs to get a handle on. The lady that checked us in was very nice and took time to show us a map even though there were several people behind us. Our room was just ok. Small and a bit outdated. Housekeeping came so late one date we couldn't get our room serviced because were were in there getting ready for dinner. The location of the hotel is good, tons of shopping. We ended up walking to fishermans warf which was definitely a hike, but worth it! There are homeless people everywhere outside the hotel, though that may be a SF thing. Room service was ok, definitely not worth the price. One morning I ordered french toast and to be honest I took one bite and couldn't eat it. It was really bad and room temperature. Hotel guests get complimentary access to Equinox which was great. We were celebrating our 5th wedding anniversary and the hotel did have champagne and chocolate covered strawberries waiting in our room when we arrived which was a very nice touch. Overall, if I ever get back to SF, I'm sad to say I won't be staying here."
"We always enjoyed staying at this hotel. Rooms are nice, service is good and it is in a good location. We have not been here for two or three years. We were very disappointed in the new dining design. The lovely seats are gone. Everything is modern, the name has been changed to Bar Market, there are computer tables which is fine but it just does not seem like a Four Seasons. The restaurant area also is very modern and cold. We ate in the bar area and chose from a very limited menu. The food was okay but not great. I must say breakfast was nice. Another very uncomfortable part of the visit which is not the fault of the hotel but still very uncomfortable, is the amount of homeless camped outside of the hotel. The homeless population in San Francisco has sky rocketed in the past few years. Very sad. We checked out and moved to the St Regis. This was the best decision as our stay was terrific!"
"Before even arriving at the hotel, the Concierge has been most helpful with my queries and assisted with making a reservation at the restaurant and collecting my parcels on my behalf. Thanks to Joe and his team! We arrived at the hotel slightly early from the LAS flight, but our room was ready for us. Check in was smooth and there were refreshing drinks available for guests at the hotel check-in area. The room has a view of the Yerba Buena Gardens. I really loved that there are chargers connected to the hotel room phones - every time, I returned to the room, I easily take out my devices and charge them by the bed. The bathroom was spacious for both me and my mother. Amenities were stocked and refilled during the housekeeping. In the evening, the turn-down service crew will come through and ensure there is a bottle of water by the bed. This is always a nice touch that I appreciate when staying at Four Seasons (FS)! Dinner at hotel restaurant, MKT, was fantastic as well. Our server, was an exceptionally sweet lady, and made every effort to ensure our time there was wonderful. Having not had enough time to arrange for transport to the airport, I approach the Concierge desk at 10pm to make the arrangements. They looked into the request immediately and within an hour, they quietly slipped a letter under the door to inform me that the car (a BMW) will be waiting for me and my mother. I spent 3 nights at the hotel and enjoyed my stay immensely. The staff in the hotel always makes an effort to acknowledge your presence. Four Seasons SFO is located on Market St, hence many of the major shopping names are along the street. We had no difficulty navigating around the area. It's always lovely to stay at a Four Seasons property and I look forward to returning."
"Checked in at the Four Seasons on Market street and from the moment we walked service, customer service and attention to details. The room with a view, a restaurant MKT primo! Food & service superb! Front desk always resolving any concern or requests. Will be back. Oh by the way, it's surrounded by plenty of Walgreen's, CVS, and retail stores. Fabulous all around!"
"The rooms were tired, more than me even with significant jet lag. Certainly not of typical Four Seasons standard I have come to expect, what happened SF?Now, in my view the two things that can make or break a hotel experience are the Concierge and the Bar Man. Here they both broke it. Concierge tried their hardest to seem disinterested, never following up with the promised message nor email of confirmation and generally pretending to be a concierge in Paris. The bar boys were looking stressed and concerned for their side of the space only treating customers as a kind of annoying distraction whilst throwing empties loudly in to two large visible blue plastic street sized bins. What 5 Star bar serves drinks in such a manner? They could not have cared less for creating a convivial bar scene - they belong in a yuppie bar not a hotel.As for the rest I can't even waste your time, nor mine, to write it all out.Jus fail."
This hotel was incredible. I was there for my birthday with my boyfriend and I absolutely loved it!! I would return cause I didn't get to go to the restaurant I don't remember quite well if it is asian but it looked really really yummi!! Is a must at san francisco
"Visited for Dreamforce '16. Couldn't have been more perfectly placed right next to the Moscone center. Rooms were class, with a great work desk and phone chargers by the bed and desk.Service was second to none, emailed me itemised bill within a couple of hours of requesting and a hand-written apology and fruit for having to wait a little while for my room.Massively recommend it."
"Beautiful hotel, great staff and awesome restaurant/bar. Loved the stay and it's the only hotel in San Francisco we'll stay at. They had a full size crib to accommodate our young daughter already set up on our arrival. Even though the hotel is downtown the hotel suite was very quite and the beds were very comfortable. The drive up entry to the hotel is a bit odd and in an alley but other than that the hotel was lovely and what you would expect from a Four Seasons."
The hotel was gorgeous with excellent restaurant and bar service and our room was perfect. It was a bit strange upon arrival redirecting ourselves from one elevator to another. Maybe a sign or person to guide you (we saw others confused by this as well). Public transportation was available for 2.25 each just to right of hotel. Uber was very quick to arrive as well. Great location for upscale shopping and convenience. We would love to see Four Seasons join most other hotels in offering complimentary water upon arrival either at front desk or in your room. It's so appreciated after a long travel day. We had a great stay and would recommend to others.
"Located just off Market this hotel is right in the middle of downtown. My room is what one would expect at a Four Seasons. Great views from 2 of the four walls. Teriffic bed and furnishings. The bar had plenty of energy and of course great drinks. Only negative...Breakfast this morning for 2 was $91 before gratuity!!! Oh, and that was without cocktails!This hotel came with all those little details that makes the Four Seasons have the reputation that it has. "
"By Four Season standards the rooms are dilapidated. Not nearly enough electric circuits in the room, none by the bed! TV old and channels displayed poor quality. However, the location, service and staff are great. "
"We have been staying here quite a lot to visit our daughter who goes to school in the city. I have tried other hotels in the city, but will only stay at the FS from now on. They truly make you feel as part of the family and the hotel from top to bottom is 5 star."
We came for a five day pleasure trip and could not have been more pleased. The concierge arranged for us to be picked up at the airport and when we arrived everything was ready for us.When we arrived at our room it was facing other buildings and there was jack hammering constantly making noise. I called and explained to\he front desk staff and within minutes offered a higher room which was not much better.They apologizedthat no other rooms were available because of the Oracle convention in town but offered us an upgrade to one of their best suites at one third of the original cost . We choose to stay in room anyways because of the increased cost.We could not be happy with the room itself the excellent service and staff.When we called for anything it arrived at our room in minutes.The concierge helped us on numerous occasions and score us last minute tickets to the Alcatraz tour.Excellent location and when needed had a cab in minutes.Upon a return visit to San Francisco we will stay here.
This Hotel is in the Best Location and you truly won't receive better 5-star service. Four Seasons is the best hotel in the business and if I could I would never stay anywhere else. During the holiday season they welcome you with cider while you check in. We stayed here after I had a hysterectomy at the age of thirty to celebrate my husband 30th birthday just for one night. Our spirits were down but we felt special and cared for. San Francisco is a special city and the Four Seasons is the best.
"When a hotel receives two conventions in less than a month why would they care about someone staying for 11 days? And they know me since I come to that hotel often. It was mt third time in less than two years. The reception is very good. The service is however not a five star one. I had to ask repeatedly for stuff like coffee and water to be resupplied. (It is a service supplied so they should deliver) The housekeeping burned my shirt sleeve when I sent it to laundry. WhenI complained they just sorry and sent it out for a 24 hours ""service."" They just ironed out the wrinkles caused by the iron burn causing another dent. No compensation just someone came to my room to say sorry. (She wanted to see the shirt by herself) I am not sure she was a manager since I've seen her greeting people on the door at market street. So no manager to be seen. I was not attended to when I call claiming that they had clients. When I go down there were 5 guys and no clients. I stayed many times and I wonder if I would stay again in this hotel that costs around 900 dollars per night. I must say that the gym is fantastic but it is not theirs, it is the equinox. The restaurant is slow if you are seated in the bar. I was seated in the bar once and I waited almost half an hour for an omelette during my breakfast. My friend who was just visiting noticed how they were dismissal and wonder why would I be there. the rooms are very small. The bathrooms are substandards. The closets are very tight. They do supply nespresso machine if you really insist otherwise they don't deliver if you just ask."
"Wonderful stay - second time in 3 years at the Four Seasons, Enjoyed a wonderful room, bright and beautiful decor, so comfortable. Reception and Concierge were so helpful. Also, bar and restaurant service was excellent. Stayed in one other hotel in SF recently and whereas it too claimed to be 5 star really it didn't compare to the Four Seasons. Looking forward to my next trip to SF and another stay at the Four Seasons. Can't recommend it highly enough."
"The hotel, rooms, and service of the Four Seasons are flawless. I've stayed here a couple times, and so far, I have not been disappointed. The concierge are always pleasant people to work with - they're very accommodating and welcoming. The rooms are clean and up-to-par as soon as you enter your room. I'll definitely be back soon. Thank you to all the staff at Four Seasons who made my stay a wonderful, and unforgettable experience. Your work is greatly appreciated."
It's not a 5 star hotel.. Good location but does not meet the standards of the expected 5 star hotel. Rooms are ok.. Looks like it needs updating and service is ok too. Nothing spectacular. I must say the complimentary Equinox gym is a plus! Service is just mediocre as well. I love four seasons hotels but I have to say.. Pass on this.. Definitely not worth 400-500 per nights.
"Stop over at the Four Seasons Hotel in San Fransisco , the hospitality what you are accustomed the expect from the staff , and servers at the restaurant meet and exceed your expectations . Booking the stay thru #amex you will reap the benefits of early /late check out when available ."
"Room very nice Only bad experience with the people in front deskNobody speek French, they didn t present the hotel facilities ....Nice room with a very comfortable bedConciergerie is very usefull and people orking there very good. do not hesitate to ask them to help you"
"There is a lot to say, so I will break up the review into sections: Room, Amenities, Location, & Service. This was primarily a vacation over the weekend with a little business mixed in.Room:We booked 2 rooms that were connected. The rooms are spacious with a window bench. We paid a little more for higher up rooms and it was worth it. Our view overlooked the roof of St. Patrick's Church and the Contemporary Jewish Museum onto the grounds of Yerba Buena Gardens, especially the water fall. We all loved the window bench as it was a cozy place to read a book. The rooms were large and very comfortable. Beds and pillows were luxurious. Windows had blackout curtains. Bathroom had a walk-in shower and separate tub -- water pressure was great! A nice touch is that the toilet had a separate door. Also, the connection was actually not just a door, but a little walkway of about 4 feet. Enough distance to allow true separation between the rooms, but with both doors open, a connection.AmenitiesThese are truly tech forward thinking rooms. Plenty of power and usb plugs on the desk and by the beds. Also, each phone had a number of mini usb to thunderbolt connectors that allowed you to plug in and charge directly. I didn't even need to pull my charging block out and used only 1 cable for 5 computers and 4 iPhones. The bathroom amenities are supplied from L'Occitane en Provence and are wonderful. Towels are thick and absorb water. They had slippers in large for me and medium for my wife. There is a good hair dryer.In the room, there is a bar by the door and complimentary waters through the day. Also, there is a safe under the TV. The TV is a flat screen with standard cable package.In the afternoon, there is complimentary ice tea and flavored water in the lobby. In the early, early morning, they have muffins and coffee out.Workout facilities are with the Equinox gym, which is well appointed with machines and weights, a salt-water lap 25m lap pool and basketball courts.Location:So, their automobile entrance is not their mailing address on Market, but around on Stevenson. While this is a little detour, the placing of this entrance is well situated to get around town. There is easy access to all the highways as well as the major streets in San Francisco. I had no problems besides traffic getting to the Mission, Fort Mason, or South of Market."
"We had a lovely stay at the SFO Four Seasons - check in process was easy, staff were helpful and responsive, and in room dining was of good quality. The hotel rooms are comfortable but one thing that struck me was the layout was not so intuitive (separate rooms for concierge, front desk, lifts) and may need a bit of an upgrade."
We stayed here for 4 nights celebrating a birthday. It is only steps away from the museums and the SF jazz center. We really enjoyed the museums and attended a concert at the jazz center. There is lots of shopping across the street. No water views but we didn't miss it. Concierge was top notch and arranged a lovely semi private Napa valley day tour. Take advantage of the included breakfast. It was very good. 
"Typically crisp Four Seasons property but clearly doesn't want to attract anyone who enjoys coffee. After spending time at a Langham property with pod machine in each room, I was surprised to not only not find the same here, but not find any coffee making in room at all - not even instant.The other issues surrounds the breakfast which charges an arm and a leg yet provided the worst coffee I had on the trip (80% froffed milk) not to mention having to ask and wait for a glass of water with breakfast. maybe move to buffet guys as a la carte wasn't working for us at all, lots of staff, no service. Aside from that all good."
"A traditional hotel with safety assured and a warmth that is exuded by all staffThe rooms are comfortable , pillows devine and beds super comfy.Whilst the rooms may be dated they are certainly clean and comfortable but need a few modern upgrades USB ports ... The concierge service knew their stuff..Stu"
"Never had to wait for an elevator.....incredible. Great hotel, fantastic service. Wonderful location. Vibrant bar scene. Great breakfast. Fantastic gym. Within walking distance of great shops. Uber friendly. "
"This is a review that is mostly good but has a poor ending. Been staying at the Stockton and California Streets Ritz Carlton facility for 24 years. It is surely a 5 star place, and this stay was not different except for one thing. The rooms were 5 star, the food 5 star, the lounge and grounds star and the people, 5 star. The reservations system seemed 2 star. I booked 4 rooms for 3 nights for a family reunion on Sept 7th. Upon Checking in, I asked to extend one of the rooms for 1 additional night (admittedly, a Saturday night). I was informed that the hotel was sold out that night. I said that I would take any class of room, on any floor but that didn't want to pack up my elderly mother in law (87) and ask her to move. I asked to be put on a waiting list and waited 3 days. . I checked twice per day for the three days of our stay but got nothing. I cannot imagine a hotel of that size had no cancellations for 3 nights. I wondered if there was a convention in town but found many last minute options at the Four Seasons, Loews, and Intercontinental upon checking online. I made one last inquiry upon checkout at the Ritz Carlton and was told the same thing, ""all sold out"". It would have been better to have the desk ask me if there was something they could do to help us find another facility for the last night, but nothing. No, ""we are sorry to you have to move out"", no, ""can we assist you in any other way"", nothing. The really bad thing for the Ritz Carlton chain is, we REALLY liked the Four Seasons better and we would have not gone there due to our loyalty to the Ritz Carlton brand, worldwide. Sorry Ritz folks, we found something better and you made that happen."
"This place was built about 15 years ago and it shows. The rooms are somewhat dates. But it was clean and elegant and well run like you'd expect from the Four Seasons. We were there for a corporate function and only ate what was catered at the event. The food was absolutely outstanding, some of the best food I've had anywhere. Hope that I get to go back here someday."
"We traveled for our anniversary. We got in early and were given a room several hours before check in. Loved the room, deep soaking tub, large windows and spaciousness. Bed was so comfortable I was able to sleep through the night which I can't even do at home. When we arrived we dropped our luggage and took off for sightseeing. When we returned that evening we were greeted with a bottle of Prosecco and a plate of chocolate covered strawberries and fruit. The concierge was extremely helpful and accommodating. Car rental arrangements were without issue of any kind. All of the staff consider little extras, i.e., cold bottles of water to take with you when you leave for the day, etc.Of course you do pay for all of this as this hotel is not on the cheap end (and parking is about $65 per night), but I would definitely stay here again."
"Prime location, comfortable and clean rooms. I had no issues. If you want a slight step up in comfort and are willing to pay for it, I'd be happy here. Only issue is two elevator rides to get to your room."
"We travel to San Francisco a couple of times a year and Four Seasons Hotel far exceeds any other hotel that we've stayed at in the City. The restaurant food is excellent, staff is knowledgeable, helpful and prompt, the rooms and decorated beautifully. Despite its central location, the rooms are incredibly quiet and my husband and I sleep like babies! Can't wait to return."
"More than a luxury brand, this is probably one of my favorite hotel in the States. I believed that everyone here wanted to make my stay warm and wonderful. They generously had the hotel cars chauffeur me in the past, and made a huge deal over my birthday. On my 25th birthday, they sung happy birthday and left little tokens and a cake behind. Years later, it remains the same!! "
"The same as one in Hong Kong, very Four Seasons standard. Very healthy food and we can order breakfast even at 4 am. MKT becomes already a very social place for Bay Area in high level. Know Chiko from Hong Kong for 10 years and she made our trip perfect"
"Had a superb visit! Would highly recommend staying in this property! Great location, smack bang in the middle of everywhere you want to be! Forget the alcohol night-caps, a hot chocolate is an absolute must!Spent quite a lot of time lost within the lobby. It is quite confusing, be prepared and have a good sense of humour!"
"I had originally booked the Ritz and cancelled because they said they couldn't assure our rooms would be adjacent to one another. The Four Seasons gave us an adjoining room so there was no decision there. The service was excellent, breakfast was as good as anywhere. Only reason for 4 stars instead of five is that the hotel is ready for a renovation - not that it is really tired, it is a FS after all and they maintain impeccably - I just noticed a few things that were ready. We will be back regardless. "
"The Four Seasons was a wonderful property. We enjoyed the location, staff and our room was lovely and spacious. We had a great view and wish we could have stayed longer than just one night. The front desk staff and concierge both provided great advise on shopping, getting around and restaurant selections. The bathroom had great light, which I always appreciate as well."
"Although the general character of the Four Seasons San Francisco has changed over the years, the hotel continues to provide the consistent, excellent service and luxury that one would expect from a Four Seasons. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. Most rooms have a view of the city.The bathrooms are amazing....wonderful shower and bathtub. Housekeeping does a fantastic job. Check in is efficient."
Great service and fantastic location. Our room wasn't ready when we checked in so we stayed in a comfort room for a few hours till our suite is available. The staff is very attentive and nice. The amenities are nice too.
"My wife, daughter and I stayed for four nights at the Four Seasons in San Francisco in late August 2016.The hotel had many positive attributes, but I can't recommend for the reasons listed below.First, some positives: very good service, room in great condition, nice children's play room.My issues with the hotel:1. When I called to make my reservation, the representative agreed to waive the $75 daily fee for the roll-away cot that my daughter used during her stay. But then when I received my statement upon checkout, the fee was listed for all 4 days. When I raised the issue, the agent removed the charge. Still, this fee should not have been on the bill at all.2. I realize the website does indicate in fine print the limitations of the pool, but my wife did not see that language when she booked us at the hotel. This led to a significant disappointment for my 8 year old daughter when she realized she couldn't use the pool. A hotel of this caliber needs to have a pool. This is a deal-breaker for me, and I cannot recommend this hotel to anyone with children.3. I don't understand why a hotel as good as Four Seasons doesn't have coffee in the room?!? This is bizarre to me. My wife is a big coffee drinker. Each morning I had to drag myself to the lobby at 6:30am to get coffee for my wife and me. Why do I have to get dressed and go out in public to get coffee? Even two-star hotels have coffeemakers in each room. Also the coffee hours are way too limited. By 9am or so some mornings, the coffee was gone! I prefer to have coffee in the afternoon. Why do I have to pay for coffee when every other hotel I've been in this year (at least a dozen hotels) would have allowed me to have a cup in my room at whatever time of the day I preferred.3a. My wife was in the children's play suite when a hotel employee asked if there was anything she needed. My wife mentioned that the free coffee service (with very limited hours) had ended, and the employee said no problem, she should just ask for a cup from the bar -- which my wife did. Little did we know when we checked out that we were charged $7 for that cup of coffee! Crazy!I have loved the other Four Seasons hotels I have stayed at throughout the U.S. Unfortunately, for the reasons listed above, I cannot recommend this hotel."
It was a pleasure staying at the Four Seasons. A company is only as good as it's people and Four Seasons proves that with their wonderful staff. Everyone was welcoming and kind throughout the hotel. We always felt welcomed.
"The Four Seasons is perfectly located downtown, an easy walk to shopping & restaurants, but also overlooking Buena Vista Park. My room was lovely, spacious with a nice view and had everything I needed. The staff were also very professional and friendly. I'm local, but stayed in San Francisco for an early meeting the next day and was very happy with my choice. "
For a luxury hotel this is a very intimate one - almost like a boutique hotel. It had one restaurant and one lounge which I prefer to hotels with several restaurants and acres of public areas. The room I had on the 14th floor had great views of the Union Square district and was not overlooked. It was spacious and well appointed and in beautiful condition.
"From the moment we walked in through the front doors, until the moment we checked out, our experience at the Four Seasons SF was nothing short of Fabulous. I live in SF and just wanted a small Staycation with an old friend. We primarily just enjoyed the luxury of the room and stayed in and laughed and reminisced. It was a lovely evening!"
"As you would expect from the Four Seasons, impeccable service (particularly the concierge) and very comfortable rooms. I struggle to find any fault. Its location is perhaps not ideal but being away from Union square was a positive to my mind and it was close to a couple of excellent restaurants."
First time staying in four seasons. Awesome experience!! Awesome service !! Room & location was very clean. I would definitely would check in to four seasons hotel in the future . Next time I would need to dine in to MKT restaurant for my next stay visit.
"Beautiful city hotel in a good location. Walking distance to Union Square, shopping and many wonderful restaurants nearby. The staff is wonderful and accommodating as you would expect for a FS. There is no Spa but you do have access to the Equinox Club for a workout and steam but didn't use it. Walk the SF hills and you will get a much better scenic workout. I had a corner room which was very nice with great views. Rooms are quite spacious and as usual the bathrooms are very nice with marble floors and sinks. The decor is quite nice."
"... they may be struggling to find an identity. Are they ultra-hip, snooty and soulless (a la Ian Schrager), or are they warm, service-oriented, and brilliantly efficient (a la Four Seasons circa 2000).I'll lament yet again about the restaurant side of the chain - the gradual demise of the ""Four Seasons restaurant"" brand and how they've seemingly replaced that with third party concerns that offer much less cozy and tasty experience.At this one especially as of late, the waitstaff appear terrifically friendly, but it has been feeling like it's a rehearsed kind of cheeriness, almost overdone. Which always makes me wonder how they're *really* being treated. They're super perky, yet continually forget little things, like the little sugar bowls, actually following up and taking my order, not knowing what kind of hot sauce they actually have, and little things taking longer than they should.And - horror of all horrors - they still insist on using those damn little tiny Tabasco bottles! You know the ones - with the green plastic safety wrap around the neck that is impossible to peel off. They should be at least ""pre-peeled"", but the server often forgets here. Okay, yes, I am being a little tongue-in-cheek here, but they should at least offer the much tastier Cholula as an alternateThe food is still reasonably good, however, but I remember when it was stellar. Sigh.But as far as the actual hotel, the rooms are still very nice, and I especially love the ones that face Market St. They may be a bit old, lacking a few power points, etc. but the staff more than makes up for that. Beds also ae showing a little wear, which is surprising to me. Mine was a little softer than usual and a bit saggy in the middle.Also, valet parking is $57 plus tax a night, so be warned. And there is no public parking nearby."
Was never told when booking or any other time that men's spa was closed for renovation. This is something the customer should know in my opinion. Also room smelled of smoke and there was a loud sound of running water behind the AC. We were moved to another room which was better. Sunday at 11:30 restaurant full. Was told 25 minute wait. Sounds odd for a hotel guest.
"Not a great experience at all. Don't waste your time - Stay at the Ritz, they at least accommodate their guests! The outside feedback is not great either. I should of listened to my friends. There are so many restraints and rules at this hotel. 8 am coffee cut off time in the morning?"
how do they get the service to be always so amazing across so many countries and cities is a mystery. But whatever you do please don't change anything! The one in SanFran also happens to be the best hotel in the city and we always tray there.Highly recommended.
Stay was what you would expect from a Four Seasons managed hotel. Good facilities. Great Staff. Good Restaurant. The location made getting around easy. We would stay there again.We were really impressed with the staff at all levels. On departure the bellman arranged a Black Car to take us to the airport for less than either a taxi or uber. The weekend brunch menu was really interesting. Who pairs chicken with waffles? It was really good.
"The four seasons chain gives a certain level of expectation and this certainly met it in terms of efficient friendly service but the bedroom was clean and comfortable but disappointing. It looked tired, needing modernising with dull furnishings. Cupboard and storage space dispersed and poorly designed The bathroom was the same. The bath was small the facilities poor and the toiletries supplied meagre at best . Good atmosphere in restaurant and bar. Access to large gym Location second to none "
"It was my first time in San Francisco and stayed at my fav hotel, Four Seasons. I have to admit the hotel is great, service was excellent and located in a very convenient area. I walked everywhere from the hotel, very handy! It's closer to Westfield Shopping Center and all other high end designer labels, loved it! I will definitely come back. Thank you for making my first trip to San Francisco memorable (it won't be the last )"
"Great location, excellent staff, really good restaurant, great facilities, very clean, modern and orderly. We very much enjoyed this hotel, its a really great place to stay as you explore everything San Francisco has to offer."
"The Four Seasons Hotel San Francisco fits nicely into the typically good and luxurious hotels operated by this hotel Group, with this property having a nice subtle Asian feel. Well appointed and comfortable with the typical excellent staff, and located right downtown and within close walking distance of the Cable Cars, shopping and excellent restaurants, this hotel is a great place to stay in SFO."
"This hotel is in a perfect location for business in down-town San Francisco, most things being within an easy walking distance. There was a problem in that an item of laundry went missing. However the hotel were very good and sorted this without any issues."
Conveniently located hotel in San Francisco with a Great Breakfast lounge .Lobby is located on a higher floor so you need to always take a lift to get to the lobby level and then change lifts to get to your room.Service was average and could be improved. Food at the bar and restaurant was good
"This is a lovely property with a good location, although the taxi entrance is confusing, and Uber drivers sometimes go to the Market Street door and sometimes to the side door where taxis go. The room and quite nice, but not over-the-top. Only one restaurant in the hotel, which is fine -- considering the number and quality of restaurants in San Francisco anyway. I didn't find the staff particularly solicitous, and I was somewhat taken aback that I got three notices slipped under my door asking me to contact the front desk to discuss an issue with my credit card -- after I had already spoken to the front desk about the matter."
"The hotel share the pool with local gym, and it was truly, sadly, very unpleasant. The water has a salty taste you dont want to know whats inside. And the pool was very small, with 9 lanes all divided by floating dividers, you cannot swim at leisure at all. I bruise my arm trying to swim breast stroke after hitting my arm on the narrow divider. I spent 10mins in the pool and 20mins trying to wash myself off whatever is in the pool off. It was very disappointing for a Four Seasons."
"The same superior service one expects from Four seasons hotels...never disappoints . Front desk staff pleasant and efficient; spotless rooms; helpful concierge service, great location in relation to the airport "
"The Four Seasons San Francisco make for an unforgettable synergy of the ultimate Guest experience. Their dedicated Hotel Staff are sure to exceed your expectations. Setting style and panache, attentive service and award-winning cuisine that will gratify the senses and palates of the most discerning Degustateur - like you!"
"I love the Taj on union square - absolute service there. I took a risk with fourseasons this time and boy do i regret it. This is basically Motel-6 at 600$ a night. the corridors and rooms are so under decorated. It feels like i am in a model-6 that charges 600$ a night and not at four seasons. I even tweeted about how dull, boring and depressing rooms and corridors look. Very cheap property. Nothing amazing at all. Two disconnected elevators before you get to your room. The gym is not worth it seriously.. The MKT (or what ever the restaurant is called) has very careless staff. When i was waiting for my room to be cleaned up I walked in - the hostess was gossiping with the bar tender and just looked at me and continued to chat. When a guest walks in it is common sense to drop your movie gossip and immediately attend to the guest. This is common sense and when I am paying 600$ a night I expect a higher level of service. The second time I was walked in and waited 10 minutes - there was NO HOST OR HOSTESS. I walked in morning for coffee and breakfast. I left and complained to the front desk about the lack of attention at the restaurant. What do i do when i walk in - find a place and sit? wait? will they even know i am seated? Why is the hotel charging premium prices for such lack of service and attention to guests. Being on market st. is not an excuse - this is not the typical four seasons standard. Taj would have provided exceptional service and its nearby to four seasons. I am absolutely not pleased."
This hotel is my idea of luxurious business travel. Excellent amenities. Great bath products. Well stocked mini bar. Exceptional front desk staff. Working computers in the business center. Access to Equinox health club.
Everything works here with a seemingly effortless style. Rooms are just gorgeous and public areas stylish and very well maintained. Bar and restaurant are excellent but expensive.What really makes this a great hotel though are the staff. They really seem to care.
"Let's start with the gym -/ seems a unfair word - pool, boxing area, basketball court, endless classes. Truly phenomenal Restaurant- tick, great vibe even for breakfast Amazing location and great rooms.The concierge - an Austrian chap I think is amazing - couldn't do more to help!"
"My family spent three nights in the San Francisco Four Seasons hotel in June. The location is great, close to shopping and the starting point for the cable cars. It is a little further to the waterfront, but still an easy walk. The rooms are lovely and the service is, as in all Four Seasons, impeccable. I will note that the hotel does not have much personality. When you walk through the lobby, restaurants or the health club, it feels very corporate. It also has fewer amenities than you typically expect in a Four Seasons. I would definitely stay here again for business trip, but for a family vacation, next time I will choose a hotel with more charm."
"I stay here 4x a year. An excellent hotel, run to Four Seasons standards.• Staff: everyone’s well informed and helpful.• Rooms: Market Street side rooms a bit noisier if you open your windows, but soundproofing works well with windows closed. Yerba Buena side quieter with beautiful southeast views of San Francisco bay. All rooms I’ve stayed in are spacious. Well-lit with plenty of outlets, including USB. In-room safe accommodates 15” MacBook. • Like the rooms, bathrooms are spacious, plenty of towels, great amenities. Separate shower stall and tub.• Wi-Fi: free works fine. I’ve never had a need for higher bandwidth (paid) option.• Equinox Health Club- free for hotel guests. World Class facility with pool, machines, weights, and classes. If you prefer to run outdoors, doormen are helpful with advice. I take Mission, Howard to Embarcadero, then south to AT&T (Giants) Park. Four and a half miles round trip and less crowded than either Market St, or Embarcadero going north.• MKT restaurant: excellent food and service for dinner. In the morning there’s complimentary Peet’s coffee, tea, espresso etc. Delicious blueberry muffins are my incentive to set the alarm early.• Housekeeping- twice a day, thorough, never miss anything. • Tip: when arriving/departing use the Stevenson Street (rear) entrance off of 3rd Street. (221 Stevenson Street works in Google Maps, or ask the doormen) Uber, Lyft, and taxi drivers will thank you: Market Street’s congested with an abundance of pick up/drop off regulations that seem to change monthly. Stevenson St is quiet with a full circular driveway."
"Right on Market Street near the convention center, so if you're there for a convention at Moscone Center, this is perfect. Elevator from ground floor to Lobby, then second elevator to rooms, so security is good. Typical nice Four Seasons rooms and amenities. MKT bar/restaurant is a nice option in the hotel for lunch/drinks/dinner. Excellent staff."
"Perfect home away from home in Bay Area. Easy walk or public transit to almost anywhere. Knowledgeable, helpful staff. Beautifully appointed, well lighted, comfortably sized rooms. Great restaurant and room service menus. "
"This hotel is absolutely perfect in every way! If you're staying in San Francisco and want to be in the center of everything ...this is the place to stay! Our travel plans changed last minute and we booked The Four Seasons for our last two days in California and boy did we luck out! The entire staff from the front desk to house keeping is amazing. The room was spacious, impeccably clean and beautifully decorated. The bathroom was large and the shower was amazing! The restaurant was excellent as well with a wonderful staff. I would highly recommend staying at the Four Seasons and I look forward to staying at their other properties in the future. "
"Could not ask for a better hotel or staff. We stayed here after three mediocre days at Meadowood in Napa Valley where the rate was $2000 a day. Service, room quality, convenience at the Four Seasons were all better for a much better price. The hotel staff made our eight year old feel welcome, and arranged first rate evening child care for us. The executive suite we booked provided ample room and the beds and showers are wonderful. The location is also perfect for a home base for tourism. I felt like the staff was genuinely welcoming from the front desk check in to the housekeeping team. The food in the MKT Restaurant was consistent and good and again the staff was stellar. Highly recommend. Have stayed here and other luxury places in the City and the Four Seasons is head and shoulders above everyone else."
"We flew from Taiwan to San Fracisco nonstop. Decided to layover for the night before we journeyed on to El Paso, Texas. This hotel is in a great location with plenty of entertainment around it. We got there early and there was no issue checking in early. The bell staff was great. Took care of all of the bags we had. The front desk staff new our names before we got to it and greeted the entire family. When we got to the room the girls were surprised to find a stuffed toy on their bed. Overall the room was better than expected. Very clean and had lots of amenities. The mini bar was well stocked. We went down for some breakfast at the restaurant and was greeted by the host by first name. Ushered to a nice table, the food was outstanding. Bottom line this hotel was by far one of my favorites. I wish I got the names of the staff but we got in so early I didn't think of it. I defiantly know what it is like to be a four seasons guest. Best service you can get and worth the cost."
No possible complaints. We had a large corner room on a high floor. Very bright. Large bathroom. Hotel is professionally run with style and efficientcy. Four Season standard.Excellent restaurant with good staff and we had a waiter with an excellent knowledge of American wines which he was pleased to demonstrate. We were strangers in San Francisco and found the position within city convenient.Can recommend without hesitation and would return. Unfortunately luxury priced. Look around for deals.
"Best hotel experience I have ever had. Service level is amazing. Concierge like no other. Easy check in with special gifts. Great bar and breakfast. Awesome room service. Friendly, helpful staff. Great location"
"Elegant, luxurious hotel which kept up the Four Seasons' quality standards. Room was cozy with good view. Comfy bed. Loved the bright, well equipped bathroom. Once business matters were done, we could walk around easily to Union Square, etc. Helpful and friendly staff."
"nice suite, clean, good and friendly housekeeping. (we had our granddaughter with us and the extra sofa had to be converted every night). good and fast roomservice, good and helpful/efficient concierge but extremely arrogant brakefast reception lady! if you pay over 1200 dollars a night I wish to choose my empty brakefast table and not be assigned to the cats table in the back! also not attentive and prefers to chat with other staff than to attend the waiting line of patrons....alsobrakefast is extremly expensive, 53 dollars plus service for a tea, granola with yoghurt and some toast.... overall is it worth it? NO"
"I have stayed at the Four Seasons on multiple occasions over the past 4 years. The Four Seasons is a high quality hotel with an impeccable staff. Starting from check-in, the front desk staff was extremely professional and helpful. Check-in was problem free. I have stayed in both basic rooms and suites. All rooms are consistently modern and clean. The bathrooms are quite large and clean. The water pressure in the showers are always wonderful. The beds are extremely comfortable. Room service is efficient with timely delivery. The menu is varied. The quality of the food is very high. The hotel itself is well maintained. The facilities are immaculate. The spa/gym is also of solid quality. In summary, the Four Seasons is perfect for business travelers, families, couples, singles, etc. The hotel is centrally located in downtown San Francisco. I would happily stay at this Four Seasons property in the near future."
"I stayed here with my girlfriend for our anniversary and made those notes on the reservation prior to check-in. During a smooth check-in process nothing was mentioned about any special accommodations as my girlfriend was standing by me the whole time.When we arrived in our room we were both surprised to see a nice bottle of chilled champagne and chocolate covered strawberries, in addition to a thoughtful note from staff.This set the tone for an incredible stay. Our room was on an upper floor and the views down to the street and amount of light coming in the windows were both impressive. The room itself and common areas of the hotel were equally impressive in terms of fit, finish and cleanliness.It's a Four Seasons, you get what you expect from this outstanding operator."
"Wanted to celebrate a bit and be close to stores around Market Street on a Friday/Saturday. As this board points out, parking expense in SF is terrible. Major hotels charge about $68 p/n, we opted for ""park and pay"" rate which included parking. Do your homework on driving to hotel - it's quirky, the valet parking is not on Market but on Stevenson off of 3rd street. We paid a small fee to upgrade to the a deluxe category and were placed in a corner room on 15th floor (1527). Room was quiet. Great bathroom and amenities. Very odd bed arrangement -- only one bed-stand and light. None at all on one side. So no place to set coffee or water. The only electrical plug supporting the bed was directly in the middle of and behind the headboard. The lone light and bed-stand had no outlet which is very unusual these days. Room service and turn down were wonderful. Late departure until 2pm was approved to support the shopping. Loved the complimentary coffee in the lobby and breakfast was amazing. Best scones ever. The service by everyone is exceptional and all the superlatives are well deserved here. Mission accomplished."
"Great location. Outstanding staff that go the extra mile. Parking is expensive, but so is all parking in San Francisco. Parked our car and didn't use it again until we checked out. We could walk or use the cable car to get all over the city."
This is such a great hotel. All the staff are so helpful and polite. The bedroom is very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. The food was also very good. I fact our stay was faultless.The hotel is in an excellent position.
"Very friendly and helpful Front Desk and Concierge. Best Housekeeping I have experienced for years.Bar to recommend. The Restaurant capacity is to small on rush hours in the morning, espec. when you're in a party of 4 and more people."
"One of the biggest strengths of the Four Seasons franchise is their consistency in service and their brand regardless of geography. I stayed for four days right before July 4th weekend and I was given the same great treatment I always receive when at a Four Seasons. I arrived early (like 10am) on the date of my arrival and I was able to get my room. After traveling cross country, having the ability to relax a little bit in my room was a life saver. The rest of the week I didn't require much as I was here on business, but the hotel amenities never disappoint. Having access to the first class gym next door is a great perk as is the wonderful location being close to everything on Market St. I look forward to a return trip to this hotel."
"The accommodations are very nice, exactly what you expect from a Four Seasons - very spacious rooms and bathrooms, high end amenities. Staff is very helpful and customer service was top notch. The location for us was perfect, we were able to walk to most of the restaurants on our list as well as the tourist destinations, such as the Wharf and China Town. The only negative I would point out is that the entrance, if you're driving in, is difficult to find. The hotel is on Market Street, but the entrance is down a side street in the back. That fact should be pointed out more prominently since we had drive around in circles (which is not easy to do in San Francisco) and finally had to call the hotel to get directions on how to get in. Otherwise, we had a great stay."
"This is probably the best hotel in San Francisco. Superb decor - still feels very fresh and new. superb service as is expected from the Four Seasons. Room was excellent - big, great bathroom, good products. The gym might be the best of any hotel - its attached to an equinox and hotel guests have their own entrance that is within the hotel.As I mentioned, the location is a negative. when I was there, the doorman was having an altercation with an inebriated person and two doors down, there was another issue with another drunken person outside a restaurant. Location is good for business in that its within walking distance to most offices. But tricky for a family trip."
"I've stayed at several other Four Seasons hotels (Baltimore, Seattle and Hong Kong) and have always been incredibly impressed with every aspect of the hotel and service. While the lobby area and restaurant at the Four Seasons San Francisco is elegant and up to Four Seasons standards, the rooms (at least my room), were really disappointing. The room was no more special than a Marriott, Westin or other upper middle market hotel chain. The decor was pretty boring and the furniture mediocre. There was no suit valet stand. There was also no coffee/tea setup, which is pretty standard in most decent hotels. Frankly, I would rather stay at the St Regis for the same rate (I'd actually pay more for the St. Regis), or even the Park Central, which used to be the Westin. The only good things to say about the hotel were the service and the free use of the Equinox club attached to the hotel.As much as I love Four Seasons hotels, I won't be staying at the Four Seasons San Francisco again."
"I have stayed in many of the hotels in San Francisco, but always come back to the Four Seasons. The location, superlative service and beautiful guest rooms make this hotel the perfect choice. From check in to check out, everything was perfect."
"If you desire a pampered spa, this is not it. This is 95% health club and the spa is 5% and an after thought. The spa lockers are combined with gym members and is very gymnasium as opposed to a pampered spa. The spa waiting rooms are the size of closets, not very zen at all although there's fresh water and tea available. As soon as we start the Gentleman's Zen Spa 80 minute massage, construction sounds come pounding through the whole treatment room area. Not zen, no warning, not up to par for a Four Seasons experience. The massage was very nice, not the greatest but it passes. The facial was great. Wouldn't change a thing except the construction noise that seemed to pound through the whole time. Would not go back before trying other luxury spas in the area first.When booking at a Four Seasons, I expect perfection and 5-star service. This was a nice gym with a spa attached as an afterthought."
Stayed here for 1 night with my wife and was very pleased. Nice size guestrooms and nicely appointed. did not use the spa but the bar was great and breakfast in the dining roo was excellent. Location was also ideal near Union Square.
"I do a LOT of travelling. I travel for pleasure at least 2-3 times a year but I do more travel for business. I stay in a wide range of hotels. This time, my wife and I travelled, just to get away. We decided to stay at the Four Seasons Hotel in San Francisco.The hotel is what it should be. The hotel itself is immaculate with all the amenities you'd expect from a 5 Star Hotel. The main reason for my review however is the incredible service we received from the Concierge ""Timothy Quintana"". He is by far the absolute best Concierge I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. From renting a car, to planning a day in wine country to booking us dinner reservations, this gentlemen knows his craft well and is an absolute asset to the Four Seasons chain and this hotel in San Francisco.If you're lucky enough to stay here, make sure Timothy takes care of you. You won't be disappointed. "
"Everything just as it should be. Well located hotel, well trained and attentive staff, comfortable guest room that is more than adequate size, tastefully decorated, well stocked bathroom, well insulated and quiet for sleeping, and double thumbs up room service."
The hotel in downtown San Francisco lives up to expectations of the brand. The gym / pool / sauna complex in the same building is very nice and has fairly long opening hours; nice views from the top floors.
"We stayed at the end of march in San Francisco- after some weeks in the Maledives and Tahiti it was a refreshing pleasure for us,to stay once again in a City like San Francisco a Hotel lioke 4 S (before we stayed 1 week in the really excellent 4 Seasons in Bora Bora)The 4 Seasons in San Francisco was exactly, what we were looking for-some luxury- the room spacious including the bathroom, WiFi,Minibar,aircon Room Service,a Restaurant with a really very good kitchen-but rather short menu selection- (the surprise was only in the morning-no breakfat buffet- but an interesting(we are Europeans) menu list and quick waiters., comfortable bar to have a chat with other travellers or as well with a VIP Ladyfriend of ours,who came from San Diego to meet us.And what was final pleasure for us after dinner:There is a very great terasse for the smokers (not a stiny smokerscell,but a terasse great and with mamy plants.It was a good experience to feel ypourself not as the usual outcast.Everybody of the staff friendly,helpful"
"This was my third visit to a Four Seasons hotel in the past six months. In addition to San Fran, I've had the pleasure of staying at the Los Angeles and Las Vegas properties. I enjoy the services and amenities provided by the brand and always check to see if they have properties when I travel.The FS San Francisco is a nice hotel in the heart of the shopping district. It's an easy walk to the business district and a bit further to the piers and wharf. Being in the heart of the shopping district comes with pluses and minuses. It's convenient for shopping, eating and people watching. Yerba Buena Park is right around the corner if you need to stretch out. The downside is outside of the hotel is very crowded and you do encounter a large homeless population. I was well aware of the location when I booked the hotel because I travel to San Fran for business. People new to the city might be a bit taken back.You can enter the hotel on the street level, but the reception and lobby are on the 5th floor. The public gym, Equinox, occupies floors 2-4. This Four Seasons does not have its own gym or spa, but you are able to access Equinox during your stay.The hotel decor is primarily Art Deco and has cool calming hues throughout. I enjoy a more minimalist style, especially compared to some of the more ornate luxury hotels in the area.Our family had an Executive Suite and found the room very large by and standard. It was well decorated and well appointed as I've come to expect with the brand. The two downsides were the view and the pull out sofa for my teenage daughter. We were on the seventh floor and basically looked out onto an ugly roof and the wall of the next building. I understand you can't always have the best views, but for $855 a night this was somewhat of a disappointment. My daughter found the pull out sofa to be very uncomfortable, especially when compared to other FS hotels. It appeared to be a piece of lightweight memory foam. When I tried it I understood her complaints. You can feel every spring digging into your back.The other issue I had with the hotel was around their ability to accommodate two requests. It was my daughters birthday during our stay and I had mentioned this to the concierge who said they would be glad to send something up and recognize her, this never happened. The other issue was around our breakfast credit. We received a credit of $87.50 per day for breakfast, but on our last day we had a very early flight. I went down to the front desk to see if they could provide us something small in the morning (we left at 4:00 a.m) before the restaurant opened or if we could apply the credit to anything else, including a meal the night before we left. We received a simple no. No alternatives, no suggestions, no anything. While we found the rest of the hotel staff very friendly and accommodating, especially house keeping, these two instances left a bad taste in my mouth. While I am loyal to the brand, I will most likely try the St. Regis, Fairmont or Ritz upon my return. "
"The hotel is perfectly located near everything we were doing in SF. our room was very pretty although it probably could be updated - furnishing wise. The size of the room was excellent. Our service at the front desk was so professional. We were offered the hotel driver when we asked for a taxi , which was also a very nice touch.We had a wonderful experience and we will be back!"
"We've been coming here a few times each year since the Mandarin closed and I don't know what I was thinking not to have come sooner. We drove our rental car into the driveway and were given a parking ticket to give to the concierge so she could call National and have the car picked up. We went to the check-in desk where one of the men said ""welcome back Mr. Anderson, good thing you checked in online as it's busy today because of the Gay Pride parade. We have the same room you had last time and I put a copy of today's New York Times in the room for you as we we're selling out. Everything about this hotel is superb.....and, by the way, the Equinox Gym is spectacular. I could live here all the time.......but then I'd be way too infantilized."
Wouldn't stay anywhere else in San Fran - service excellent lunch and breakfast. Only downside lotsOf homeless walking outside and when we asked for a tour to Napa they stated we didn't need reservations -If you going to see a top end winery you do need a reservation. But I would stay here again when in SF.
what a great hotel and talented team. hotel is well appointed. Excellent restaurants' and well worth the time to dine. Front desk and lobby located on the 5th floor and easy access to hotel elevators and restaraunts 
"I staid 4 days in this hotel, the location is amazing, near great restaurants and shopping options. The room was great 0 noise and great darkness with the drapes that aloud me to sleep late and rest. The breakfast is really good and the view from the restaurant is also good. I would come back for sure"
Excellent staff who was very helpful from the time of check in till the time of check out . The location of the hotel was the best location in town as I compared to other hotels when walking the town. A very nice hotel it looked to be 100% up to my expectation of a Four Seasons hotel! would for sure pick again when back in town. I was in for a convention and easy walk to Convention center - my wife and I extended the trip for a mini vacation after convention ended ! 
"Staying at this hotel is like visiting a friend. From driving up at the valet to the front desk familiar faces greet me by name. The service is always excellent, food, room and amenities are always great. They think of every detail and always make you feel appreciated. They even surprising you with a little box of chocolates for returning guests, very nice touch! This is my favorite hotel in San Francisco."
"Great stay! The staff assisted me (after arriving very late at night) and even walked me to the elevator. They were going to deliver my bags to my room but I always prefer to that on my own. The room was great, the view wasn't the good but I didn't request a view, and you can never go wrong with their L'Occitane soaps! They have a great bar on-sight too!"

We had a great time celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary. The Four Seasons Hotelsent champagne and chocolate covered strawberries to our suite and the celebration got started. Thanks Four Seasons
"Espectular hotel, extraordinary rooms, great bar and lounge. fantastic service in all aspects, the only drawback is that the room door could not be locked, I warned, came but was not repaired. Avise twice and no one came to fix the inside door lock"
"We liked this property very much. The rooms are as you would expect from a four seasons city hotel. The staff was all friendly and accomodating. The concierge was excellent from responding to emails, and helping with reservations and tours. It was a good stay."
