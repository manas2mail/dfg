Review
"We really appreciated the consistent service at the club level. The staff performed in an excellent and helpful manner at the club level and it’s great to see the same service weekend and weekdays.We also tried the lounge bar (excellent service, food, and drinks) and the spa. The spa was less-than-hoped-for as the attendants were distracted and disorganized due to construction. Additionally, it was extremely disappointing that there were no XL robes (only medium!)....this, making it very uncomfortable to relax.Overall we loved our stay but the spa was an incredible disappointment!"
"a tired hotel that needs refurbishment. the facilities a lacking. the location is cool. near chinatown. the club level is a great idea - but done better at other Ritz Carltons. The redeeming feature is the staff. they are always pleasant and cheerful and willing to help.the rooms need work. soft furnishings are good, but fittings are dated. the bathrooms are from the 80's. cant work out if i would back again.probably not on business, but for a break, but then the prices would have to come down to reflect this."
"This really is a wonderful wonderful hotel. For a special occasion or you really want to impress, this is the hotel to head to. The staff are wonderful, rooms are good sizes with all the special extras you would expect from a hotel of this calibre"
"Our room was clean and well appointed. We loved being within walking distance to many San Francisco attractions. Service was fantastic and we would definitely stay here again on future trips. The concierge did a wonderful job of recommending restaurants and must see attractions, we can’t recommend this hotel highly enough!"
"OVERVIEW:• The Ritz Carlton, San Francisco is five star hotel located in the Nob Hill area of San Francisco.• The building itself is impressive and looks majestic, not like the typical large hotel.• We found this centrally located for our purposes and not far from a variety of local tourist areas. Many attractions are within walking distance, if you don’t mind the hills - a fact of life in San Francisco.• The lobby was a little formal from my perspective, but certainly nice.• This lives up to the usual Ritz Carlton high standards of service and quality. Overall the service was excellent. ROOMS:• We stayed on the club level floor in a city view room.• The room was clean and spacious with a nice bathroom area.• The staffs that cleaned and serviced the rooms were excellent.• The club floor is more expensive, but the food service and drinks in the club room are excellent. The club room also has dedicated concierge services and a business facility.RESTAURANT, BAR, & FACILITIES:• We had drinks and appetizers in the main bar area. There was nightly entertainment and the service was very good. The prices were a little high, but typical of San Francisco.• The exercise facility was spacious and well equipped. BOTTOM LINE:• The hotel, facilities and service are excellent. We enjoyed our stay."
"Yes the Ritz Carlton Does come with a very certain level of expectations - which more than disappointed us! Among the least of which was waiting for ages sitting waiting for our room at a time promised. It would sure seem there is a definite problem with the servicing of the rooms to keep hotel guests waiting like this. Once we did arrive at the room sometime later - the room itself was nice. The biggest and most disgraceful of ALL is upon checking out the next morning, the Valet drives our car from the Hotel Ritz Valet Parking to us, our brand New Audi - damaged with a Dent in the door!!! We were perplexed - stunned this happened in a hotel of this caliber. We immediately approached the front desk explaining, to which we were followed out to the car by Mr. Bipin Sivapragasam & Alex Chiem- & later on after much emailing and calling, Mr Nate Apostol who assured us along with photos they took - that we would be well taken care of to get our car repaired along with utmost apologies. This was 2/18/18. Today, 3/8/18 - it has been nothing but being passed off from one person - passing the buck to another person and on ! No one taking “real” responsibility. Words cannot express the gross incompetence of this hotel. I am hoping not to take this to the next level. As a native of SF, and previous hotel guest, I will most certainly not recommend this hotel to my business partners, associates and friends along with public relations if this is not taken care of expeditiously.

"We recently spent two nights here as part of an anniversary trip and had a wonderful time. We were upgraded to a Junior suite and it was beautiful. Concierge provided great restaurant recommendations and made reservations for us. Valet and bell service were very helpful too, always made sure we had umbrella if needed, and water or coffee. Location is great too, quick walk to great restaurants."
"The Ritz is hard to beat. Excellent service, beautiful rooms and fantastic food. I stayed on the club lounge level and highly recommend it. This level provides a conceirge, and foood and drinks throughout the day. No need to ever leave the hotel. The level of customer service is unparalleled to any hotel I have ever stayed at. Well worth the price to indulge for a few days."
"The hotel room was situated right over the bar where live music could be heard all night. It was shocking that a hotel would place a family with two children in this room - none of us were able to sleep. Dinner reservations were made the following day with the hotel concierge. Upon arrival to the restaurant, the restaurant informed us that they told the hotel that they could not accommodate families that night. Why would The Ritz-Carlton not tell us about this prior to the reservation? This was incredibly embarrassing as we were with another family and had put our trust in the hotel. While the hotel did have a kids room, it was not in a secure location and looked like an afterthought. "
"We decided to spend three nights at the Ritz-Carlton as part of a California vacation to celebrate a milestone birthday. The staff, especially, made it such a special stay. Almost every single person working in the hotel greeted us by name, each time they saw us. I don't even know how they did it - it's a big hotel and it was busy! The concierge staff was incredibly helpful too. This was a last minute trip for us, and so I had little luck making reservations. We called them while we were driving from Monterey to San Francisco, and they called us back a couple hours later with a reservation at a Top 10 restaurant that I had tried and failed to get into on my own. They also set us up with a private driver to take us to Napa the next day. (He was an absolute professional and gave us the most wonderful day in Napa).Our room was beautiful - one of the largest hotel rooms I've stayed in. It had three closets, and a huge bathroom. The bed was super comfortable; and when we came back to the room after my birthday dinner it was covered with rose petals and there was a plate of chocolate covered strawberries. We had breakfast at the restaurant, drinks in the lounge, and room service and everything was top shelf. We asked one of the bellmen where we could get some ice, and he insisted on coming up to the room to get it for us. Everyone was just so helpful and friendly. The location of the hotel was great, very close and walkable to a lot of the sites you want to see. They also gave us rides to our dinner reservations a couple evenings. I wouldn't hesitate to stay at the Ritz-Carlton again. The rates are somewhat expensive, but the level of service and the little extras that they give you make it worth every penny."
"Loved this hotel, friendly upscale, nicely appointed rooms conveniently located to walk and enjoy the city. Food in restaurant was very good too! Hope to be back soon. Friendly accommodating staff. Nice coffee amenities in lobby and in room daily"
"Only stayed here for two nights, but really liked the location. lots of things to walk to from here. The rooms are smaller than many other Ritz Carlton's, but the building is nice and the staff were fantastic."
"Very disappointed in the food. Been staying there for years...it used to be fabulous...something for everyone. This time, not so much. Breakfast was good...the rest of the day...meh. We were surprised...not in a good way."
"Fantastic hotel with wonderful service. We loved our stay here. Our room was lovely and comfortable, they welcomed us with chocolates and macaroons, and they welcomed our baby with baby bath goodies and a rubber ducky. We were made to feel right at home. Their club level food and drink offerings were wonderful and I really appreciated the gluten free offerings! We will definitely return on our next trip to the city!"
Ramesh is amazing. My husband and I prefer to frequesntly eat our dinner at the bar area because of how great Ramesh service is. He pretty much knows when we need his attention. He always make the best Manhattan and vesper martini
"We stopped in on our way down the “hill” (feels more mountainous” to me! And had drinks and a snack. It was positively lovely! Great service and the Chinese dumplings were really yummy. And the presentation was lovely, served in a Chinese basket over dry ice!"
"First time I’ve stayed at this property after more than a dozen visits to SF for business. The service was impeccable and I stayed in a JR suite which gave me plenty of room esp for SF. Property is tucked away half way up California street so as a runner you can slip out and head through Chinatown right down to the The water. Great shopping is a short walk away. The restaurant Parallel 37 is fantastic. Everything about my stay was perfect. The combination of location, service and comfort is unbeatable. Also since it’s tucked away (unlike Fairmont, Omni, Westin) the room was very quiet. A big plus! "
"The Ritz is located on Nob Hill which is a short distance to Union Station, Little Italy and China Town. The friendly staff aims to please from the doormen, front desk and housekeeping. The rooms are quite large with comfortable beds and pillows. Highly recommend."
"After switching hotels to the Ritz, we have been absolutely thrilled with the service, the accomodations, the location and the food (albeit hotel pricey). The pictures on this site do not do the hotel justice. Our room is classically decorated, the bed so comfortable and the bathroom adequately spacious. The location in Nob Hill on Stockton Street is ideal--central and easy to walk to many attractions."
"Great Nob Hill location on Stockton Street that feels residential and very classic San Francisco. Walk three blocks down the hill and you will find yourself in the middle of Union Square and its endless shopping and dining options. The guest rooms were renovated recently, and the navy and gray color palette is really comfortable and classy. Fitness center has expansive workout rooms and great equipment. The Club Lounge at the Ritz is exceptional! There are four complimentary food and beverage presentations throughout the day, including breakfast, a light lunch, hors d'oeuvres and cocktails, and dessert and cordials. The food was amazing and there were plenty of gluten free options at every presentation. The evening hors d'oeuvres are inspired by San Francisco's neighborhoods and, on Saturdays, there is a special caviar presentation paired with a limited edition sparkling wine from the JCB by Jean-Charles Boisset Collection. The Club Lounge exceeded our expectations in every way. You can't go wrong at the Ritz San Fran."
Great upscale property in the City by the Bay. Check in was smooth. Received a clean and quiet room. Bed was comfortable. Water pressure was fine.Conciere lounge kitchen staff were all friendly and helpful. Conciere lounge desk person was a not as friendly or welcoming.Conciere lounge food was mostly very good.Cleaning staff was very good and friendly.One of the tub valves had a significant stain.If you are looking for a more upscale property then you probably could not get do much better than this property. It is on a hill but SF public transportation is very good.
"This is the second time that I have stayed at this Ritz Carlton in the last six months. Once again I can not give it 5 stars because of little things.As with my last visit the staff was friendly, terrific and helpful. It is in a great location. Nevertheless, given the chain's reputation and price little things matter. The last time I stayed here my devices did not charge overnight because I did not leave the overhead light on. This time the room thermostat did not work. As a result I turned it off rather than have the air conditioning run at 67 degrees all night. Additionally the door latch did not work. I also stayed at the Marriott Marquis this trip. It is much more of a business hotel and in a much busier location. Nevertheless, everything was perfect"
Great hotel in a good location. Of course it is a bit more expensive than others but you get what you pay for in life and in this hotel. We stayed here for a few days prior to going on a cruise from San Francisco to New York via the Panama canal. 
"Yep, its pricy, but the rooms are outstanding, the towels and linens are of the finest quality, and the staff first rate. The restaurant is of 5-star quality but the big surprise to me was the outstanding wine list and appetizer menu. If you want to splurge on yourself, this is the place to go. But bring your equity line of credit to pay the bill."
"We came here for my birthday weekend. Everything from the check in to the room to the service was amazing. The price of the room was a bit on the high side, but luckily I used one of my hotels.com free nights, so that eased the price a bit. All of the staff are great. A few greeted us by name as we came and went. Everyone was very friendly and went out of their way to help in every way. The rooms are spacious, but most of the rooms only have partial city views, since there are only nine floors. The rooms were very clean, updated, and beautiful. The beds are very comfortable and big. The bathrooms was great with two sinks and a wonderful shower. The food and drinks downstairs were great, but super expensive. They had nice music in the early evening. Parking was very expensive....65 dollars a night, but it is comparable to most other hotels in the city center. You might be able to find a parking space on the street, but good luck. Overall, this was a great stay. "
"The hotel is nice, up to date decor and friendly service, but definitely over priced. Good location, which is most likely driving up the price, but still.....Be prepared to pay extra for everything you need. Again, most likely an industry standard, but shop around. I stayed in Russian Hill area before and do I d it to be very affordable and a short walk from this location, so shop around. $65 per night to park.....$75 for the small bottle of wine in the room. I also have a feather allergy and had to have the pillows replaced, which the staff gladly accommodared. I have stayed in some really nice luxury hotels across America and found that these rooms fall a bit short of expectations for the price."
Came back to the Ritz San Francisco for a short weekend stay. Arrival at the lobby (since I was driving in) was smooth and the valet / bell staff was super helpful with luggage etc. Check-in was a breeze - possibly because it was later in the evening. Room was a bit of a walk from the elevator bank but well appointed and very quiet. It overlooked the internal courtyard but allowed ample light in. Housekeeping service for turn down was excellent and the room has all of the amenities you may need. Enjoyable experience and a great location for a stay in the city.
"The Ritz comes with a certain level of expectations and this one doesnt disappoint. The rooms are spacious, with comfortable beds and all the amenities. Service is wonderful - everyone greets you and smiles and makes you feel welcome. Location is also convenient. Just be aware that they no longer have a pool but they have a lovely gym and spa. Breakfast is on the pricey side but it is very good."
"My boyfriend decided to surprise me with a weekend in San Francisco while I was traveling in the west coast for work. The Ritz delivered a luxurious weekend. The rooms are beautiful, the treatment received from the staff was top notch and the club lounge is worth the extra expense as it provides amazing food and drinks throughout the day. I recommend using the gym and spa if you can find the time... amazing facilities and products. "
"First the good - excellent rooms, best lounge I have ever used, faultless service. The slight negative is that on booking online I selected a city view room. There are no great views of the city so don’t be fooled! Location is a couple of blocks from Union Square but it is a bit of a climb back to the hotel. All in all, superb!"
"We visit San Francisco often for both work and friends because my wife used to live there, so we have many opportunities to try many different hotels in the city. Out of all the hotels in the city of San Francisco, Ritz-Carlton is our most favorite. Hotel staffs are always attentive and polite, hotel rooms are always very clean and very welcoming even before the renovation. As for city view, Fairmont has the best view from our experience since they are further up the hill, but Ritz-Carlton does have good city view from club level rooms.There is no swimming pool at this hotel which is what my wife wish they would one day offer, and there is no on-site parking structure. Valet parking service parks vehicle at St. Mary's Square Garage which is down the hill so make sure you get everything you need out of your vehicle before valet moves it to the garage. You can also park your vehicle yourself at different garage and save $30+ a day instead of $65 + tax.Club level is great if you will be spending a lot of time at the hotel instead of browsing the city."
"We were blown away by our experience at this hotel. Every staff member went out of his or her way to make us and especially our 2-year-old and 6-year-old feel like royalty. We booked a suite and loved that they had a full-sized crib for our toddler and a very comfy rollaway for our older kiddo. Apples, bottled water, and fortune cookies were plentiful in the lobby, we enjoyed great cocktails at the lobby bar, and we were able to change my daughter out of her ballet clothes at the spa when our room wasn't quite ready upon arrival. Parking is valet only, $65/night, and offers complimentary EV charging. The location is in the very swanky Nob Hill neighborhood which feels very safe, but if you aren't able to hike super steep hills, to get around you will need to use a car service, figure out the streetcars, or stay somewhere downhill. We enjoyed the workout provided by the hills, especially with all the delicious food we ate in the neighborhood. We thought our suite was fabulously updated and our only critique would be that the shower and tub are pretty small. Also we wish they had a pool, but we were so busy sightseeing (sight-eating?) that it wasn't a huge deal. We'd definitely stay again and again."
"I stayed here back in September of last year as part of a business/leisure trip.The hotel is situated in a fantastic landmark building in a very central part of San Francisco, approximately 5-10 minutes walk to Union Square.Check in was very quick and friendly as you would expect in this standard of hotel.The interior of the hotel is amazing.We stayed in a club room which was really modern with an excellent decor, amenities and great space.We particularly liked the club lounge which was a nice place to unwind in the evening. We also had a fantastic breakfast here and also a superb light evening meal.We were also luck to have a meal in the private dining lounge of Parallel 37. The food and service were amazing.All in all a fantastic stay. This is real luxury hotel that combines all the modern facilities and amenities you would expect with excellent service."
"Fabulous. Service was above and beyond expectations. Rooms were immaculate, pretty, spacious, and comfortable. We had an excellent view. Club level food service was particularly nice in the afternoons and we loved the endless champagne. Location was perfect for checking out the city at Christmas time. Holiday decorations were festive and lots of fun seeing all the young families arriving in their party clothes for Teddy Bear Tea."
I nearly didn't write a review as the names says it all... But it was better than expected! It's the little things that made this hotel above the rest.... We are a family of four and when I book a hotel I book for 4.. But many times I'm asking for more towels even though the hotel knows how many are staying... But the Ritz always provided extra towels... Enough water for us all... Welcome champagne!! Free hotel car if your traveling in the area!! Thank you! We used this service many times! Fabulous staff with great information on where to eat... And the room service was delicious.. The only suggestion would the rooms needed a little more lightning... Bathrooms were well lit!!
"We had four nights here from 23 rd December, a great location, right next to China Town and a couple of blocks over from a Union Square. The hotel was clean and it was nice to retire to the lounge after a busy day sightseeing. We were able to walk from here down to Fishermans Wharf in about 20 minutes, nice touches like the small sweet treats delivered to our room, and a great team serving drinks in the lounge, we didn’t get our servers name unfortunately but he was so helpful pointing out bits of interest to see in the city. We did have an incident occur in the lounge one evening where a couple completely over reacted to a fellow guests dog running across the hall, they were kicking off about the dog or animal as they called it being out of control! I hope the management took their complaint with a pinch of salt as it seemed to be a completely unnecessary rant about a 10 inch dog who at no point was out of control !!"
"We stayed here for 5 nights in a club room and thoroughly enjoyed it. Location is great, you are only a few blocks walk from lots of things to see and do. For example, China Town, Finance District, Union Square, Ferry Building and waterfront area, etc. Be prepared however for some step climbs, remember you are in San Francisco!The hotel itself is a beautiful building and our room was well appointed. It was what you would expect from Ritz-Carlton. The staff were all amazing , in particular Rudy and Starsky who were both in the Club lounge. We would definitely recommend this hotel and will use it again. "
"This is a very nice and exquisite hotel in San Francisco that caters to the “upper end” traveler. There was no pool or hot tub however all other services, hospitality, cleanliness and other amenities or top-notch. We had a very enjoyable stay in the staff was extremely friendly, courteous and helpful. We had a broken view of the bay and Alcatraz however it was a $12-$18 ride to pier 39 and the waterfront. Chinatown was close by and all in all it was a very nice place to stay."
"We stayed a family of four on the executive floor and we enjoyed every bit of the stay. Everyone we super friendly and nobody even lifted an eyebrow when the kids entered the club lounge (they nevertheless did not make any noise).Due to the fires in Napa, we were unable to take a trip to Napa, so we decided to bring Napa to the hotel and enjoyed some very interesting Napa wines in the wine bar on the ground floor.Everyone we encountered were super friendly, We were able to both have an earlier check in and after check out we were invited to enjoy lunch in the Club lounge upon waiting for departure. A nice gesture."
"First time staying at the hotel. Everyone was friendly, the hotel was well located and the house car to take you to close spots was awesome. The breakfast buffet was better than most Ritz Carlton’s I have stayed at. I will stay here again. "
Best place I have stayed in San Fran hands down. The staff is incredible. So close to amenities and sights. Loved the high end boutique and comfy feel as well. The lounge music with great city views was fantastic for my husband and I. Our little one loved the kids space to play and relax too.
豪華な建物で、大変に立派であり、かつ全般的にメンテナンスも行き届いていて、しっかりしたホテルだと思います。なお、坂の上にあるので、ホテルに戻る際にはUberをご利用されることをオススメします。なお、リッツ・カールトンにありがちなことではあるのですが、建物の豪華さや立派さに比べて、従業員の方のサービスレベルはあまり高くないです。一流ホテルとは思えない誤請求があったり、ホスピタリティの欠如した雑な対応、更には間違った説明があるなど、失望させられることが多々ありました。一回で物事が解決することはなく、複数の方に確認をし、同じ要望を繰り返し伝えないと、対応して頂けませんでした。また、503というコーナーに位置するSuiteに宿泊しましたが、夜の間はずっとボイラー音が鳴り響いていましたし、上階の宿泊客の大騒ぎによる騒音に対して滞在中何度もフロントに連絡しましたが、遂に改善されることはありませんでしたし、対応した/できないという報告もありませんでした。特に残念だったのは、従業員の方が人種差別に対して鈍感であることです。詳細を述べることは避けますが、他の白人宿泊客から酷いアジア人差別の言動を見聞きしたのですが、それを聞いておられた従業員の方は、特段の注意もされることはなく、聞き流しておられました。他の一流ホテルで同様のことを見聞きした際には、ホテル側から差別的発言をされた方に対し注意をされるとともに、いわれなき人種差別を受けたアジア人宿泊客に丁寧な謝罪をされていたのを目撃し、さすが一流ホテルは違うな、と感じました。リッツ・カールトンには「We are Ladies and Gentlemen serving Ladies and Gentlemen」というゴールドスタンダードというものがあるそうですが、現実とは大きく乖離しており、実現には程遠いと思います。リッツ・カールトン自身が、自らのコミットメントであるゴールドスタンダードを裏切っている以上、同ホテルを一流ホテルと呼ぶことは出来ないと思います。
"As one of our annual Christmas visits to either New York or San Francisco this was to celebrate my 65th. Arriving at 8pm from the airport we were welcomed at reception with a much needed glass of champagne after a long day travelling from Manchester, England. The room was well prepared with a welcoming gift which will adorn our Christmas trees in the future years to come, reminding us of our vacation at your welcoming residence. As we have previously stayed here, the staff in club welcomed us by name, remembering us from our visits before. This makes a vacation more personal than you can imagine, more like visiting family. I can only thank the staff working in the club lounge for their friendship and the exceptional service that they provide. In particular, to Vicky, who anticipates all your needs no matter how trivial they are. To summarise, this stay surpassed all our previous stays at Nob Hill. As I plan for next year, I hope that I can fit another stay at your residence in San Francisco.In summary, I pass my thanks and sincere gratitude to all the staff for this memorable stay."
"There is something about the physical property itself: the entrance and lobby are small and not elegant. I thought the entrance was a back or side entrance at first. Our room was well furnished but small. They have recently relocated with the modern aesthetic which I don't think lends itself to the RC image. The hotel is in a great location to get to many SF attractions. We are walkers however. As another reviewer mentioned, the building is on a steep hill and the steep walking is rigorous (but that is San Francisco!). The hotel is in proximity to Chinatown, the tenderloin, etc but the surrounding streets are beautiful and we felt very safe."
We love this hotel because the location is great and the hotel has a smaller feel to it. It is our go-to stay in the city fir a night hotel. We live the bay area so when we want to treat ourselves to a night in the city we always stay here. The club level is great and always stocked with great food and wine. Cannot go wrong with the Ritz in San Francisco !!
"We stayed for a week at this Ritz over the Thanksgiving break. The location is wonderful - right next door to Chinatown and Union Square shopping, but far enough away to have a quiet atmosphere. Our club level room was expansive and extremely large. It was clean, bright, and modernly appointed. The little niceties left every day were quite a treat -- wonderful items from a local company Elizabeth W that were splendid. The club level dining was INCREDIBLE! The food was delicious, fresh, and always available. We've done many other club level rooms at other Ritz hotels, but this one was especially delicious. Would highly recommend this club level experience."
"Very spacious rooms and extremely professional staff. We were in town for the Holidays to visit our Son and had a great time staying at the Ritz Carlton. They always make you feel great and my wife and i had a great relaxing trip while staying at this beautiful Hotel, Thanks."
"Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and it was lovely. The room was excellent, the staff were extremely friendly and welcoming and it is in a very good area of San Francisco. I would definitely stay here again and would/will recommend it to everyone staying with a family in San Francisco. 5 stars. "
Priceless experience. Everyone should experience the ritz at least once so splurge you won’t regret it. We will never forget the 5 diamond treatment we received from the moment we pulled into valet and were treated like royalty. 
"Great place. Beautiful. Perfect location. Near trolley, Macy's, and great places. Have kids activities which is helpful if you have young kids. I would recommend this place for pleasure or business. Beautiful "
"A grand entrance to this world renowned hotel so I was prepared for old fashioned charm with amazing service and great food.When we checked in, instead of asking us how our journey was, etc; the lady at the reception asked us if we would like an upgrade!We were shown to a suite in the basement which was very big and very nice.Nice comfortable bathroom. A good size bedroom and a lovely sitting area.The housekeeping team keep their work stations hanging around almost all day in the corridors.Not a great look for my business clients who were coming to see me.The bar staff were great. Very attentive and happy even though they were extremely busy.The restaurant serving dinner was good. We had a lovely waiter, very pleasant.The same restaurant becomes a breakfast area in the morning.The lady in charge was incredibly bossy and rude to all the people who were made to wait for a table.They did not know how to make an omelette!!After two goes, we gave up.We were told by the waiter, we were not the only ones who had complained about the omelette. Surely one should be able to make an omelette?The foyer is kept very cold. On the day I was leaving, the Bell boy took 30 minutes to bring my luggage to the car. My driver was about to leave when it finally arrived.I was sitting in the back of my cab when my door was flung open and the man, who I assumed had something to do with my luggage, asked me, grinning, if he could do anything else for me? I said no, but he kept holding on to the car door-hoping for a tip.I thought this was awful behaviour. I did give him a tip, reluctantly, so as to get rid of him.I will not stay here again."
"Stayed for 4 nights and as good as usual. The hotel is so well run and the staff friendly, professional and easy to work with. Our room was wonderful, spacious and cozy. The Ritz is always a great chain and this one in SF is one of the best. Kudos to all."
Family trip to SF over the holiday weekend. Hotel seemed overwhelmed and ill prepared to handle volume of guests. Staff was pleasant but several areas of the service delivery were poor: Did not delver rollaway beds when promised; and the restaurant service was very poor. I love the property I hope they were just having a bad day. It would have been nice ice to see the large management staff treating the hotel capacity issue as a all hands on deck opportunity. 
Beautiful Historic building houses the hotel...close to Nob Hill and Chinatown with beautiful hilly steep street views. Best shopping in San Francisco nearby. Look for nearby local trattorias for best food! 
"We have been coming to this property since it opened. The wonderful amenities, spacious, well appointed rooms, and personal service set it apart. Its central location makes all of the city's landmarks easily accessible. The Ritz San Francisco does not disappoint."
"Our recent stay was so wonderful, we hated to leave. The hotel is well maintained and spotless. The beds were so comfortable and inviting, that I didnt long for my own bed as I usually do. The staff made us feel so welcome and cared for, that I felt we were being spoiled. I can’t wait to go back!"
"We arrived at the Ritz for one night, put our bags down at midday and was told our room was nearly ready. We decided to go walking and sightseeing - to their credit concierge was fantastic. We came back at 3.15pm to be told cleaners were in our room and we will have the keys within the hour. Reception suggests we grab drink using our $100 hotel credit in any of the restaurants within the building - but this wasn’t the case. Our credit wasn’t valid and paid for our drinks. We finally head back to reception at 4.15pm and they explain actually they’d lied - the guests were still in our room and it would be another hour or two before cleaners would have access. HOPELESS. LIARS. "
Horrible check in. Reserved rooms not available. Nothing comparable available to specific type of concierge floor rooms reserved. Indifferent attitude and resolution at and by Reception Desk. Will head to Four Seasons or Huntington Hotel on next SF visit
"Ritz San Francisco is best hotel in the city, the hotel makes everything happen for you seem effortless. There staff is the best, from the doorman to the cleaning staff, you are the most important persons in the daily activities.. love this hotel"
The hotel was lovely and in a great location. The service was wonderful and the people went out of their way to help when it was asked of them. The room was nice enough but the view we had left much to be desired. There was no ventilation in the bathroom and after showers it became uncomfortably hot and steamy in the room. The bed was extremely soft (too soft) and the sheets were okay. I had hoped for better luxury from such a well known name.
"we stayed in a one bedroom suite on the club level over the xmas weekend. our room was gorgeous. beautifully redone, spacious, great bathroom and a bonus powder room. since our 19 yo son was sharing the room, the powder room was really great for us. we were charged an extra 100 to put a rollaway in and because we were on the club level and he was an extra guest. the club level was one of the best we have stayed on. great, great staff. the food presentations were varied and delicious. the only drawback was several large families who essentially took over the club for hours at a time with loud converstaions and all day drinking but i suppose that's to be expected for the holidays. i cannot begin to say enough about the staff at the club level. they handled the noise, the crowds and kept up with the food, drinks, etc. really wonderful!!! great stay in a great hotel."
"This is the absolute best location in San Francisco for the urban experience with a touch of class. walking distance to high-end shopping, China Town, and exquisite restaurants; to return to five-star luxurious accommodations and customer service."
"Up a very steep Stockton road, this is all the old-world luxury elegance you have come to expect from the Ritz Carlton. The rooms have great views of Chinatown et al and are very comfortable in that ""you have arrived"" kind of way. Staff is traditionally friendly."
"My family only had one night in San Francisco and we chose The Ritz-Carlton due to its convenient location as it is centrally located and easily walkable to many sites and restaurant options. The hotel itself was in perfect condition and the staff was impeccable. We arrived early in the morning and were easily and politely accommodated with our room. Our bellman provided an informative review of the hotel and our room and housekeeping was on the spot with our roll-away request. Our 14-year old daughter was even treated to a special Ritz-kids treat of various popcorns, which she thoroughly enjoyed. The little touches like water and an apple after a run were all appreciated. We'll definitely be back."
"Excellent stay at the Ritz this past weekend. Hotel is clean, staff is friendly and informative. Location is perfect. We were able to walk easily to many places in San Fran. There was also great cider in the main lobby, would recommend they add eggnog as an option though ;) Thank you!"
"My 2 daughters came home from college for Christmas break and we decided to take a short last minute trip to San Francisco. We had my older daughter's fiancé with us, so I booked a 1 bedroom suite on the Club level with points. I specifically picked this room because there is a door separating the 2 areas and another half bath. When we arrived, my reservation showed I had booked just a regular room (even thought I had a confirmation email showing the suite). Alyssa at the front desk took care of it and put us in an amazing room that was perfect for us. The only issue we had was that the couch was more of a loveseat and was too small to have an adult sleep on it. I called down and asked if there was a room with a larger couch, and there wasn't but they sent up 2 rollaways at no charge! We love the Club level, and the food and drinks were always well prepared and fresh, and there was a good variety. It's alway nice to be able to have a glass of wine up there or bring it to the room while we are getting ready. We love the Ritz Carlton (my daughter and her fiancé got engaged at the Ritz in Laguna last year)"
"The entire staff could not have been more accomodating! Our car was broken into earlier in the day before we checked into the hotel, and all of our luggage and belongings were taken. The Ritz staff really helped us: taking the kids to Target to get clothes, helping me with the rental car replacement, etc. Great staff and well-managed hotel."
"Wow, a wonderful hotel to stay. Felt very special the whole time we were there. A wonderful escape from the busy city and still be able to enjoy what San Francisco has to offer. Warm, friendly staff and beautiful comfortable hotel. Highly recommend!"
We enjoyed a wonderful stay at the SF Ritz Carlton. We are locals and we so enjoyed being the city as a visitor would. The Ritz is a wonderful ambassador to those visiting SF! The turn down service for the kids was adorable!
"A great experience for my family at the Ritz SF at Christmas. Great hotel, great location, nicely decorated, great club room. All the staff very helpful and service oriented. Front desk accomodated our requests for our 3 rooms to be close together. Nice service."
"My wife and I stayed at the Ritz on Stockton over an extended weekend and enjoyed it immensely. Great location with (steep hill) walking distance of Union Square. Of course service was predictably great at the Ritz. But the property also really nailed it with the fabulous Christmas decorations and, especially, the spa. If you're looking for a fantastic location in SF, I recommend staying at the Ritz. You can't go wrong. But get suite if you can. The space is worth it."
"For our November stay, we chose the Ritz Carlton, on Nob Hill. Normally, for our business trips to San Francisco, due to company policy, the Ritz Carlton, and Four Seasons properties are “off limits,” though we do choose the Ritz Carltons for discretionary, personal travel fairly often, or when the meetings are on-property. However, this meeting fell during a major convention (it had been moved back a few weeks, from its historical dates), so lodging in San Francisco was very, very limited, and also at a major premium. All of those factors brought us to Nob Hill, for our stay. I had never stayed there, though my wife had stayed at the Fairmont on a previous trip, which I was not able to attend.I know the general area pretty well, as we often stay on Stockton St, just below the tunnel, and have recently been dining at several restaurants around “Upper Stockton.” Still, this was a first for me. We enjoyed the location, though I did have to plan some of my walking, to make sure that I was in the correct place to get to the stairs, leading to the lower part of Stockton – from the Ritz Carlton, that proved very easy to do. For my night of dining, I easily walked from/to the hotel, when dining in the Union Square Area.The property is lovely, historic, elegant, luxurious and very warm and inviting. We had a gorgeous, and spacious “Corner Suite,” No. 873. We were warmly greeted by the doorman, and then reception. Very professional, and extremely friendly, but we have come to expect that from various Ritz Carlton hotels.Unfortunately, this was a short block of meetings, so our stay was far too short. I would loved to have been able to spend a week in this suite, on this property.Our suite consisted of a large bedroom, with a living room, and separate bath area w/ both a tub, and walk-in shower, plus a separate WC, with door. The double sinks were mounted in a nice sized vanity, with good horizontal space, and then there were two glass shelves, which made storage of personal items easy. We also had a full compliment of Aspery (Ritz Carlton signature) amenities. The living room and bedroom were separated by two sliding, partially glass doors, for privacy. Being a “corner suite,” we had wonderful views, and in two directions, even just being on the 8th floor. It seems that we have had some spectacular views, from our San Francisco hotels recently.Our King bed was extremely comfortable, and the bed linens extremely nice. For once, we also had good hotel pillows. There were enough TV’s to keep one occupied, and the room had adequate AC outlets for device charging.Our ample closet had a safe, but unfortunately, it was one of those “vertical safes, where iPads, tablets, etc., must stand upright, and be angled so that they do not fall out, when the safe is opened. I am less a fan of these, but see them often. One positive is that it’s easy to see what is in the safe. My preferred horizontal safes do need a light in the door, and some are mounted so low, that one has to lie on the floor, to use them. This safe, though vertical, was at my eye-level. There was also an iron, and ironing board, plus an umbrella (unused on this trip), and a hanging valet w/ laundry bags, etc.There was a mini-bar in the room, a Nespresso coffee maker, with coffee caddy, and nuts, snacks and cookies. With all of the wine (at the bar, restaurant and JCB tasting room), I did not even bother checking prices of those in the mini-bar.Lighting in the room was very good, and with the two walls of large windows, it felt very bright and airy.I had the opportunity to dine at the on-property restaurant, Parallel 37, for Breakfast only, and also had Lunch in the Lobby Bar. During this stay, I also took advantage of the VIP Lounge, which was nice, and the lobby “wine tasting room,” JCB, part of the Jean Charles Boisset Collection – great experience, and having it in the lobby of the Ritz Carlton was a major plus!We had last stayed at a Ritz Carlton (Los Angeles) the month before. Unlike that property, which was part of the JW Marriott structure, this hotel is a stand-alone. Also, there were some notable differences in our stays. Though we are Marriott Platinum, the LA stay had been booked by our local MLB team, for us to attend their playoff game. Our status did not get us entry into their Ritz Carlton Lounge, but in San Francisco, I had access, and a most warm welcome. Just differences in properties, and also differences in stays. There is also a Fitness Center, but we did not have the time. Same for valet parking, for which we had no need. I did not even have time for the “complimentary shoeshine,” on this trip.Every person, with whom I interacted on property, from the doormen, to the reservations agent, to the staff in the bar, and the restaurant, was excellent. “Service” was the first order of business, and it was delivered in a very friendly way. Though the stay was short (too short for me), I would give the staff a perfect 100.The location is lovely, with many interesting restaurants near-by, and at almost every price point. Public transportation, something that San Francisco is known for, was a bit limited, but the California Line of the famous San Francisco Cable Cars runs along the north side of the building. Now, I find that the Cable Cars are much more an “attraction,” than a viable means of transportation in the City, the California Street Line is much better, than the Hyde-Powell Line – fewer tourists lining up for their ride, but also with a slightly abbreviated schedule, so one might wait a bit. The California St Line is also a bit less scenic, but it still has some lovely vistas, and its terminal is right at the Ferry Building on Embarcadero. It also runs past some interesting restaurants, just “down the hill,” in the Financial District. Though our suite overlooked California St, so just above the Cable Car line, it was very quiet, and I heard but one siren (on California St during the night), and that noise was almost completely suppressed. We heard absolutely no noise from inside the hotel. Walking can pose a few challenges, as this property IS on the top of Nob Hill, so there will be elevational changes involved. We found that taxis were easily accessed (the doormen seemed to just make them appear out of nowhere), and my wife used those to get to/from her meetings in the China Basin area. Then, access to Union Square is fairly easy, via those stairs that I mentioned, which are one block from the hotel. Two flights of stairs, and one is on the “lower level” of Stockton St, with Union Square, and its environs, right there. SoMa (South of Market) is just a few flat blocks away too. There is also a “house car,” depending on availability, but we did not use it on this visit.In all, a perfect stay, at a lovely property, albeit just too short. I am not sure when we will return, but it will not likely be for our business meetings – unless there are future scheduling issues. However, we plan to return for our personal travels to San Francisco, and for a bit longer stay next time."
Awesome first stay at this hotel. Conveniently located and close to everything. Staff is warm and attentive to your needs. Facilities are classic and still world class. Booked online and got a great deal but also locked in without changes. That would be the only inflexible issue once they give you their best rate. But well worth the stay and great value.
"Great facility, location and staff. Walking distance ( if you don’t mind the hills) to Chinatown, Italian area, Pier and other touristic areas. Close to the business district. Overall a great place with quality and professionalism expected. "
"Everything is always perfect and the staff very welcoming. Amazing how they always know your name and anticipate your needs. Truly a level of service above all others that is consistent at every hotel, no matter where you are staying."
"I loved the welcome we received at this hotel, the bell hop, the concierge, the bartender and the room service.The area is Nob Hill and above China Town, within walking distance to North Beach and Union Square."
"Have stayed here a couple of times (what's not to love about a Ritz Carlton?). Everything is wonderful. Staff, food, location. A friend came to visit me and arrived driving a smoking, clapped-out old banger. She was welcomed by the door staff and parking valet as though she were a queen in a Rolls Royce. Now that's good service. (I can't bear snooty places.) And they were not to know that she is a brilliant and rather famous artist. Do get involved a couple of cocktails - the mixologists can make anything. Beds are heavenly. Breakfast is delicious, and the lovely guy in the town car will give you a lift anywhere within reason. Club rooms are wonderful if you really want to cocoon yourself away."
"We had 2 issues with the room after checking in, including a non working heater which required repair: The down bedding had not been removed as was requested.When I informed the front desk, their manager Drew; was rude and arrogant.I said if we had to change rooms my husband would move what little we had in there as we had not brought our luggage in. He sent a door man up right after I said no one was to move our things and that I would be outside for 10 minutes. The doorman stole my cell phone which was charging on the nightstand.The hotel desk clerks said they would send security up to the room and I should wait there. No one came. No one called the room. They then lied and showed no interest in or concern for the this horrible situation caused by their employees.The hotel staff was unprofessional and unethical.The opposite of what Ritz Carlton used to stand for. It was the worst hotel stay we ever had. This is not a 5 star hotel. Everything about the experience from start to finish was less than 2,Stay elsewhere. Worst Ritz Carlton. The employees steal and harass guests and the owners support that."
"I was in San Francisco from 27 Sep to 29 Sep for work. It was my first time in the city. I stayed in the Deluxe King Room. It was a comfortable medium sized room. The interior decoration of the hotel and rooms lived up to my expectations of The Ritz. Staff were helpful with our various requests. Due to work, I didn't get the chance to explore the city, but the shops and restaurants near the hotel were sufficient for us. The gym was fully equipped too."
The hotel is beautiful. The staff are wonderful and professional. Restaurant bars were very attentive and the food was very good along with the drinks. The room was spacious and clean and very importantly the bed was very comfortable.
"The staff , maids, front desk, greetings as we arrived. Every single thing about our stay was perfect. The in room dining was delicious. We ate dinner in our room, not only delicious, but presentation was extremely elegant- Will definitely return, Maureen R. Agius "
"I stay in a club floor every year on my birthday. Usually in a Ritz in other cities. This club floor I'd the worst ever. The good things were the hotel worker bees - housekeeping, door people, valet parking, servers in club lounge and restaurant. Very friendly and welcoming. The hotel staff was the worst. Not friendly and rude. The club lounge concierge, Leo, was too busy on his blank screen computer to acknowledge anyone coming or going. Now to the club lounge food. Boring and cheap. I have had 100 times better in a Hyatt club lounge at one third the price. Have stayed at Laguna Niguel Ritz and there is no comparison. Now to my birthday. Normally it is acknowledged in some way. Not here. Laguna Niguel with gifts and special desserts. Here I got three roses in my room at 9 pm with no vase. Never again San Francisco !"
"Always have a good night rest everytime I stay in your hotel. The only thing that is negative is the club lounge. When there are activities, the noise level is awful. It is really fun to join your friends for a drink and enjoy your family get together but it is impossible to have a conversationdue to the moise level"
"We come here very often sometimes as a couple, and sometimes with our huge brood of kids. Josh who works at the front desk is also helpful and wonderful to work with. Veronica and Zeny in the Club lounge are awesome. Jaime who is the doorman is great!"
"The Ritz-Carlton is a place where you know before you arrive that every detail of your stay will be managed with exceptional care and quality. I took my mother to the hotel for her 88th birthday and never worried for a second that the experience would not be ""perfect"" and of course I was right. From the moment we arrived until the day we left the service on the club floor was impeccable. The room large, beautiful and all the amenities there. The food in the club lounge can compete with any 5 star restaurant--and you can move from one food presentation to the next. The concierge organized some great day time travel experiences with almost no notice. My mother remembered from her last stay that she enjoyed ""snickerdoodle"" cookies in the lounge and was disappointed when they were not there. She told the concierge how disappointed she felt and that night a batch was delivered to our room. My mother cried she was so overwhelmed with the generosity of the staff. You can't go wrong if you stay at the Ritz. Kathryn."
"I was looking forward to a quiet and peaceful stay at this hotel while in town for a 3 day business trip. The first two nights were uneventful and found the room comfortable, I thought I found a my new hotel. However, on the third evening, I returned to my room at 6pm. I was exhausted from a long week and had an early flight Saturday morning with a 4am wake up time. The room was filled with jazz music. I looked outdoors and wondered where it was coming from, thinking it was part of the happy hour. I decided to take a walk and eat dinner. I returned to the room at 8pm, ready to retire. The jazz music was still playing, but the sound had increased by a few decibels. As I started to wind down, a man came on the loud speaker and began talking very loudly. I could understand every word he spoke and was shocked by the volume. After a few minutes, I called down to the front desk and shared my concern. I was told, ""my manager will go talk to them"". The sound only increased and I called a second time. I was told that security would go speak to them. The sound did not lower in decibels but remained obnoxiously loud until the event was over. It would seem that your hotel would have informed your paying guests there was an event going on in the courtyard and rooms overlooking the courtyard should expect loud noises until 10:30pm. I was thoroughly disappointed and will not stay in your hotel again. Definitely not the experience I was hoping for."
"I loved the rooms and my stay at The Ritz-Carlton San Francisco. We arrived on a busy evening where the tree-lighting ceremony was taking place and there were carolers, hot cocoa stations and beautiful lights illuminating the building. The facade of the hotel reminds me of ancient Greece and the hotel is very stately and takes up a good portion of Stockton Street. The hotel is also close to Chinatown in the Nob Hill district and we ended up walking to dinner nearby. The staff was extremely friendly and we were always greeted and assisted. The check in was easy and if you are a Marriott rewards member, I would recommend adding your number. The rooms are very spacious and I loved the large bed, chaise lounge and attention to detail everywhere you looked. There are bottles and water glasses near the bed and on the counters. There are two closets for jackets and clothes. My room felt like a mini apartment and after leaving the bedroom, there was a dressing room with a desk that led to the bathroom. The bathroom was made of beautiful marble and two large Kohler sinks. There toiletries are a lovely brand from England and the towels were very plush. The room are equipped with an honor bar and also Nespresso machines.We also had breakfast in the restaurant and they offer a buffet for $36 or a la carte. We ordered a la carte and the menu was California cuisine with fresh fruits, eggs, bacon, sausage and many other items. The service was always stellar and our server took great care of us and had our check out so that we could get on our way. On our way out I noticed a running station with fresh fruit and water and towels for those returning from a run. There is also a club floor and gym and Wellendorf jewelry store. The hotel was gorgeous, the staff extremely hospitable and I had a fantastic stay in this luxurious hotel."
"The location of the hotel seems a little dingy but once inside it was elegant, the Decor the art work are lovely. It was a short visit but an expensive one for what it is. If your to stay inside the hotel and use there facilities it’s great, but as soon as your walk out the door your basically in china town and the streets are dirty. "
"Terrific hotel and location!! Staff was most responsive and made our stay a great start to our vacation. Nothing was too much trouble for them and we will be staying there again on our next trip back to San Francisco!,"
I had a wonderful stay at the Ritz San Francisco. It is situated in a great location within the city. The staff and hotel property itself were exceptional. I'd highly recommend staying at this hotel for business or pleasure when visiting the Bay Area.
"We my son and I came into SF for a weekend. We arrived very late Friday night so stayed by the airport. On Saturday we came into the city and checked into the Ritz Carlton. I knew the city so for some this isn't the best location but that wasn't the issue. We have tried a few of the Ritz properties and some are great whereas others are just okay. This one is just ok. There are just so many options in SF, you end up getting a lot more for your money elsewhere. The food on premises is outlandishly high, crazy to use it when there are so many super restaurant options in walking distance.My advice is to stay elsewhere as this doesn't make the cut on service and value and in terms of quality is average."
"I stayed in the ritz carlton san francisco for 4 nights and I totally regret it. It just ruined my holiday with my family. The location is the worst ever you can imagine, the hotel is accessed by hiking on a very very very steep hill. It is not a short hike even it is very long way to hike if you are young. You have to take shower each time you get to the hotel as you will be sweating horribly when you reach the hotel (even when temperature was 60F). The hotel doesn’t provide at least shuttle ride to downtown or even free parking for guests (parking at hotel is 65 dollars per day). Another bad point about the location, the hotel is located in the china town neighborhood of san francisco with such a low class area with bad smell and at night is not secure at all. Very shocked that such hotel brand is located in such bad area and the room price is extremely expensive considering such bad location. Breakfast price is very expensive also. Toilet in the room is old and outdated with only bathtub option with one overhead shower option and old fittings (no walk in shower). Although I booked two months in advance and requested for highest possible floor, I was given room on the 3rd floor putting in mind the lobby is on 4th floor!! So room is noisy as you hear car traffic easily (no sound insulation). Don’t expect any view from your room. Staff not friendly at all except the concierge. For sure if you want to enjoy the good weather in San Francisco and enjoy walking around then for sure you have to avoid the ritz calton San Francisco. "
"Booked a birthday surprise weekend for my girlfriend, from making the reservation , Check In , To Check Out ! It was an amazing weekend made special by The R. C. Staff. !

"Stopped in for a drink while in San Fransisco for business. Sat at the bar, the bartender, Jeff was very nice. Excellent cocktails. Also chatted with the bar manager Amanda, who was lovely. Will stop in on my next trip to San Fran for sure. Thank you for a lovely evening! "
"Today I checked out of the Ritz for my second stay at this location. I'd previously booked the one bedroom suite in June and I was completely enamored with the hotel, so I decided to treat myself to two different Ritz stays for my upcoming birthday-- one night at this location, and an upcoming stay at the Half Moon Bay location on my actual birthday next weekend.I requested a corner suite as I'd had in June, and I was granted that request without any hesitation. I also mentioned that it was my birthday, and as always, the hospitality and service went above and beyond! I was presented with a stone slab covered in various pastries and truffles, along with a birthday card from the hotel. How cute is that?! It made me feel very valued, which may sound silly, but half of the reason I love the Ritz so much is the fact that they have unparalleled customer service. And the fact that they were so friendly to me and my guests, despite our countless requests... it sticks with you. Five of my closest friends joined me (only two stayed over), and they completely understand my obsession with the beauty and luxury of this hotel. I will be back, probably requesting the same suite, and hopefully celebrating another special occasion! Not that my birthday is anything special, but I wanted to do something nice for myself since I usually end up super depressed on my birthday. So it'll be nice being in luxury again next weekend and feeling valued by my favorite hotel chain! Ahhhh, I love you, Ritz. Never change."
"Overall, very nice hotel, but expensive relative to what was offered. Staff was friendly and the club level was expensive but a very nice touch to our stay. Location was good, but views were below average. We upgraded to a high floor city view on club level and our view was of nothing but a half wall outside our window with a modest view above that of two buildings across the street and on the 8th floor. "
"This Ritz location is beautiful and well situated in the heart of the city but beware that it has an extreme incline on all four sides and you need to be in good physical health to enjoy. I am limited on inclines and so I had to drive to flat areas to enjoy. The only flat areas are down at the Fisherman's Wharf about 1.2 miles from the hotel. Also, it is better not to have a car because the hotel charges $75 per day for Valet with no option. Even with a handicap sticker this did not matter. Parking around the city is also difficult to find and expensive if trying to go to different locations. It's better just to purchase excursions with the money you save on parking and car rental."
Thank you Concierge Floor for an exquisite stay. Service was impeccable and rooms well appointed. We will be back. Gabrielle De grey was instrumental in enabling our family to have a great experience. 
"Being at a top hotel in a top city, it doesn't get much better than that! This Rtiz Carlton offers great views of the city and amazing rooms. Do yourself a favor and make sure you stay on the club-level that way you have access to the amazing Ritz Carlton club which serves great drinks and food. Then step outside right into the heart of San Francisco and have a fun day of exploring"
"Ritz Carlton San Francisco has a good name, but the actual experience I had did not meet my expectation. The furnishings and the guest services didn't come close to what I've come to expect. They had a refrigerator that punishes you if you remove an item from the fridge for more than 60 seconds. I recently completed a stay at the Chatwal in New York City, a new hotel brand. The Chatwal Hotel is now my new gold standard."
"We stayed here for our summer vacation in June / July. I had booked two rooms for our family of five - a one-bedroom suite and a connecting room with two queens. The rooms were absolutely lovely and pristine, with plenty of space for the five of us (which included two teenage girls and their mess) to spread out.Before we arrived, I had communicated with the hotel concierge staff re: a welcome surprise for my three children as it was their first time in the city. The staff did a fantastic job of getting everything I asked for, and adding in cute little souvenirs / gifts / candy as well. The girls were absolutely delighted. The concierge staff went above-and-beyond again a few days later for our oldest daughter's 18th birthday. They decorated the room with purple and black balloons, and left treats and a card for her. It was a fantastic way for her to celebrate.Our youngest daughter had a blast with the kids scavenger hunt, with doormen and concierges ready to assist. Whenever the girls wanted to check out a board game at reception, they were greeted with smiles and a helpful attitude. It's a great place for children to feel not only pampered, but also welcome, and I really thank the Ritz for that.One thing I was surprised with - no one ever called us by our names, except for one bellhop. You would think that, if we were staying for seven nights, it would be easy for them to remember our names (as has been the case in similar caliber hotels around the world when we've stayed at their properties) but this was not the case here. Nothing too upsetting (I sound totally spoiled, don't I?) but it is something that is a nice touch for hotels at this level to make sure their staff does as much as possible, to make sure guests receive as much of the personal touch as possible. Things like that really help me decide which hotels to choose when we are deciding on a luxury hotel stay; I'm sure I'm not the only one.One very nice story - one of my daughters has a beloved stuffed cow that was accidentally removed by housekeeping when they changed the sheets one day. She was in tears and I called reception to see if they could maybe find it for us. Not even five minutes passed, and they called back and said they had found it with laundry services. I thanked them and told them they did not need to send it up that night, as it was already past 11 pm. Two minutes later, someone called from housekeeping and said someone was coming to deliver the cow. They showed up promptly, with the cow wrapped in tissue and placed in a gift bag. My daughter was elated to get her friend back and she slept well that night. Seriously - this is what the Ritz is all about, this over-the-top service to make sure nothing is amiss. We fell in love with SF on this visit and will definitely be back. We will surely be returning to the Ritz as well with all future visits."
I stay over 100 nights per year in hotels and the SF Ritz Carlton knows how to do it right. Great customer service...best I have come across in some time. We had a special family event and they went out of their way to help make it that way...thank you SF Ritz Carlton.
"Took my wife to San Francisco for our first wedding anniversary. The hotel staff were incredible with my surprise plans to decorate the room and always told us congrats. The last night my wife was sick and rather than force us to check out, they allowed us to stay until 3 at no charge so she could rest"
"The Ritz Carlton San Francisco is the perfect location for shopping, restaurants and to see the sights of the city. The amenities were excellent and the staff wonderful! I will stay again when coming to the city."
Check in was so smooth. Alyssa at front desk was helplful and amazing! Everything is near by the hotel. Breakfast buffet and staff was nice. I will definitely come here in future and suggest to everyone!
"There was nothing to complain about at the Ritz, and I am a picky traveler. The staff, from bell service, front desk, in room dining, and housekeeping, were impeccably thoughtful and friendly. The hotel itself is modern with touches of classic architecture from the early days, but the rooms are thoroughly modern. Only downside may be the rooms primarily have mood lighting, which, in the evenings, make it darker to work in. Amenities are what you'd expect for a hotel of this caliber, with slippers, turn down service, free shoe shining, and nespresso machines. One of the most unexpected and thoughtful touches was the housekeeping staff organizing our laptop wires and cords in the room with Ritz velco straps. The bell staff were especially genuine and warm, attentive without being too friendly. If you are willing to brave the hill up to where the Ritz is located (75 degree hill--no joke) then, by all means, stay at the Ritz for some proper pampering."
"Great property, amazing staff, amazing service & Food.....have stayed at this property many times and it is never disappointing! The rooms are gorgeous and the vies from this property are in the heart of the city and walking distance from many great eateries and shopping locations."
"Parallel 37 offers great buffet breakfast. Lounge offers great lunch, dinner, snacks, cocktails. Doormen, front desk and all associates offer wonderful service and a warm welcome. Rooms offer great views of the city. "
Excellent hotel! Staff is superb and the rooms are spacious and spotless! Turn down service is the perfect touch with delicious chocolates waiting for you each night! Beautiful view from the top of Nob Hill. Close to shopping and great restaurants. 
"Beautiful architecture, comfortable large rooms, lavish grounds, great location, food and drink to match as well as a dedicated, professional and caring staff. All for a price, of course, as you would expect."
"Hard to get to. But, once at the hotel, it's worth it. Friendly, accommodating staff. Very comfortable and quiet room. Would definitely stay there again. Worth the little inconvenience of driving around the one-way streets. "
"Stayed here during a work convention in San Fran, so my company paid for the room. If I had to pay for it myself, I would not feel the property is worth what they charge per night. First of all, you have to walk up a VERY STEEP hill anytime you want to get to the property. So if you take a short stroll to Chinatown, it's a breeze going there, but save some energy for the walk back (or get an Uber!). The room was nice, but no nicer or bigger than the room I had in the Marriott Marquis. I guess it's just the fact that you can say you are staying at the Ritz? But for me it wasn't worth the cost of a room per night. There are many other chic hotels in town that charge a lot less, shop around first!"
"The lobby itself does not do the hotel justice. One can be forgiven if you were to downplay this fine hotel and its staff just from entering the lobby. It is small and almost unassuming. One is well treated from the water bottles at the driveway to the fruit and vegetable infused water waiting for you as you enter the lobby. Prices are astronomical for the breakfast buffet at $34USD per person but it is exquisite and they even have warmed Vermont maple syrup. We sat for appetizers in the lounge where we were serenaded by a lovely lady and a guitarist accompaniment. Service was exceptional, pleasant and never stuffy, it was just a lovely place to wind down. The corner room we had was lovely and had windows on both sides giving a magnificent view of Coit tower. Very good chocolate was left every night on our night table. I would return in a heartbeat."
Stayed here to attend a wedding at Grace Cathedral. Great location and walking distance to shopping areas in Union Square. Loved the concierge floor/lounge and use of the hotel car to transport us to restaurants.
a great old building in the city. The hotel has charm and character rather than a corporate template hotel. Great restaurant with lovely moderrn American / Asian. concierge services were very helpful to me with a complicated request. the rooms are a little basic but perfectly comfortable and clean. The gym is good and a great spa
Not a place to stay if you do not like walking uphill or downhill.canle car is at the street corner but very expensive for a short ride.no much views around . Away from financial district or shopping district considering walking uphill and downhill quite steep 
Great experience from beginning to end. Luxurious surroundings with genuine staff looking after you. Equipped with everything you need for business and personal needs. I had a heavy business schedule and staying here made it all the more enjoyable.
"Highly recommend the club lounge for its excellence in service, food presentations, hospitality. Well worth the money! Checking in early has always been an advantage based on our experience with the Ritz Carlton and SF accommodated. Although the staff at the front desk can provide a warmer reception, the club lounge staff made up for it."
"Beautiful wellll kept hotel, very centrally located for easy walking or short trip to attractions. The staff was very kind, friendly, and helpful. Inside the hotel is beautiful and offers many amenities. Definitely a place to visit again."
Sub par service. I’m too annoyed to write about it. I know some of you understand. I guess its important for you to look like you own a yacht. I prefer the experience at the Marriott Union Square. They went out of their way to accomodate me. 
"From the front desk to restaurant to housekeeping to valet, the staff was exceptional. The room was clean and quiet, and the bed was comfortable. I have stayed in more opulent rooms but this one definitely suited my purpose."
"I stayed a night here on 10/25/2017 and the service was just awful. We got room 755 and something ended up biting me and my mother later that night. I felt this unimaginable pain like a needle just poked me. Quickly went downstairs to immediately get a room change. I was then greeted with terrible customer service. After the whole ordeal, we got transferred to room 354 and it was unlivable. Till this day, I cant believe they would offer this room to their guest. The space was unbelievably tight and small. To close the curtain one would have to reach over the T.V. There was no space between the bed and the T.V. Completely unacceptable. After trying multiple occasion to communicate with them nothing was done. This past experience was definitely not 5 star hotel quality. "
"The staff here go well and above the extra mile to provide exemplary customer service, with a smile. Comfortable room, convenient location. A definite ""win"" in a sea of hotels all vying to stand out as special. "
"The Ritz in San Fran is the first hotel I ever stayed at in San Francisco back in 1999 and its the one I love to go back to. The hotel has been updated, since 1999, but everytime I go back it has a classic feel."
"Upon our arrival we were greeted by not one, but two, bell staff who guided us to the check in desk and then a smooth hand off to the bell captain. Once we checked in our luggage amazingly arrived within 5 minutes, which was much appreciated. Soon after we had a lot of questions for local shopping and restaurants and each of our questions was quickly answered by the concierge. All recommendations were exactly what we needed from quick shopping to fine dining. As a matter of convenience we also sought out the hotel restaurants and lounges for dining and drinks. We were overwhelming impressed by the friendliness of EVERYONE at the Ritz."
The experience any guest will have at the Ritz-Carlton is the feeling of a valued customer in every sense. The staff from the doormen to the waiters is one of friendliness and courtesy that is unexcelled. Your every question or request for assistance is handled with kindness and priority. Very rare experience indeed and needs to be acknowledged.
"I have traveled all over the world and stayed at several Ritz Carlton properties. Each one is unique in how they handle their customers. All generally do an exceptional job and have set the standard for customer service in several industries. However, this properties front desk needs some serious recurrent training starting with their front desk Manager Agatha. Her ""I could care less"" attitude is evident with all of her staff. I had verified with the hotel a week before my arrival that everything was confirmed, upgrade, access to the lounge, surprise for my mom's birthday. Everything was good to go. When I arrived a totally different story, no upgrade available, no access to lounge. After I inquired about this I was told because I was a Marriott Platinum Elite my benefits only allowed me a late check out. Agatha showed no empathy and didn't care. the following morning, as I was handing in my keys I overheard one of the front desk folks offer an upgrade to someone checking in. Interesting how an upgrade suddenly became available. I ended up leaving the hotel and moving to a much better property. I reached out to the GM of the Ritz but I am still waiting for a return call. Don't waste your time or money here."
"High end hotel with great amenities and warm, friendly staff seeing to your every need. Great location. Comfortable rooms and wonderful food. My first time at a Ritz Carlton. I was happy to have had the opportunity to stay here. Very pricey so it was a good thing it was a business visit."
"A beautiful hotel, outstanding staff and service, if you don’t mind walking turn left when you exit the hotel and walk to Union square or right and keep walking through China town down to pier 39. Everything about this hotel screams class and you woul have to be extremely awkward to find any fault."
me and my brother love the ritz so nice and excellant sevice and great recommends i highly recommed that when you come to san francisco you stay at the ritz. you well love it make sure you go to chinatown and go to the focnonefactory.
"Above the city's Stockton tunnel, sits this 4 star hotel.It fulfills the brand's original promise of quality and service. Today, we call it experience!Food is good, rooms nicely appointed. Location is fantastic!One can walk to Chinatown........walk to Union Square.......walk to North Beach........walk to the cable cars which will take you to Fisherman's Wharf and other sights?Don't wait, book!"
"Exactly what you would come to expect from the Ritz. Exceptional service, attention to detail, exquisite decor.The staff seem to be genuinely concerned with the well being of the guests. It was a truly wonderful getaway and I look forward to staying again in the future "
Love this place. The service is second-to-none. The staff does everything possible to make you feel special and to make sure your stay is perfect. I stopped down to get some candy late night but the shop was closed. The concierge got the key and opened the door to allow me to get some candy. The building is gorgeous and very well maintained.
"Very nice hotel. The service at the Ritz is at its customary high standards. More impressed with the service and staff, than the actual room. The bed is very comfortable, which is helpful for someone who struggles to sleep when out of town. "
Outstanding hotel from check in to departure. Especially enjoyed the Ritz Carlton Club on the 8th floor. Food service was outstanding. All associates were extremely courteous and helpful. My only real negative issue was the absence of a separate shower apart from the bathtub. At this high price point this should be a standard feature.
"I have stayed at this hotel consistently over the last 15 years, and I always have a great experience and am very well treated. The 8th and 9th Floor Club Lounge floors are the best and the Club Lounge amenities are great perks for weary business travel or when taking the family for vacation."
"I was excited to stay at the Ritz Carlton in San Francisco. I have been to many hotels in the past but this was my first time at the Ritz. When we got there, we were handed some bottles of water by the front desk. I must say that they were very generous with that. We never had to buy our supply of water. But somehow, I was looking for something that would set them apart. After all, this is the Ritz. And I could not find any exceptional service. Well, there was a waiter during breakfast who always saw to it that we had water or coffee. The staff greeted us when we got back to the hotel. But many hotels do these. The Internet was terrible too! It kept on dropping. I could not believe that I was staying at the Ritz in America and the Internet was not fast and stable. There was also a day when I went back to the room at past 4pm and the room was not cleaned yet! I had to ask someone to do it and he thought I was already requesting for turn down service. The hotel was very clean though and our room was big and beautiful with a view of Coit Tower.The Ritz is in Nob Hill, 3 blocks away from Union Square and just at the periphery of Chinatown. It involves steep walks though. "
"This hotel has an excellent location for accessing different areas of the city, however the decor is not very warm and the quality of the room was less than expected. We have stayed at hotels that offered more in terms of room, decor, and in-room amenities for the rate. The service and staff were excellent though!"
"I stayed at the Ritz for 4 nights on business. The service at this hotel is TOP NOTCH. It's a beautiful property,with well appointed rooms, perched at the top of Nob Hill. You really feel the charm every time you go in and out of the entrance as top hatted door men open the doors for you and welcome you or wish you well while departing. I loved the espresso makers in the room along with the turn down service every night. I wish there'd been a Starbucks on the property though you can get a very expensive small latte in the property restaurant, Parallels 37. During the conference I attended, every meal served was incredible (better than the restaurant on the property!) Definitely a wonderful hotel to stay in for a conference and I'd love to return!"
"We were staying at the hotel because we were attending a conference here. I got a couple of glasses from the bar because I had a bottle of wine in my room. After sharing this with a friend in our room, I brought my full glasses of wine to the bar to share with a friend waiting for me there. While I was disappointed when someone said they would charge a corkage fee for bringing my own wine in to the bar (note: I opened the wine in my room... so there was no service provided), I was not completely surprised. What I was blown away by was the $85 charge! They did not even bring us bar nuts. So no service, and they wanted to charge me (a hotel guest) $85 for bringing in glasses of wine. The woman was rude and I was completely offended by this price gouging. I will never come back to this property. Really offended by the way I was treated."
"From its location to the staff’s service, I couldn’t have asked for more. Quiet, good food, and within walking distance of everything downtown. Certainly up to Ritz Carlton standards. Will return next time in town on business."
"The Ritz-Carlton San Francisco is everything a Ritz property should be. Chic, elegant, comfortable, inviting. Great location. Superior service. We can't wait to return. The staff went above and beyond to make our stay down right magical."
Everything you would expect from a 5-star hotel. From the friendly smile of the receptionist to the delicious food at the restaurant. Centrally located hotel with large stylish and comfortable rooms..
"Eric and Eric at check-in went out of their way to make us feel at home and quickly resolved a check-in issue. Also, Rudy Haryono in the club was fantastic! The property is beautiful and well worth the price "
"This well located hotel also has an outstanding staff - always looking to get to ""yes"" no matter the request - very well done remodeled rooms - an outstanding club experience - treat yourself. Excellent on site restaurants but also close to local favorites"
Only two nights in the bay area this time but really enjoyed the Ritz Carlton experience as always. Room service was good selection and quick to the room all staff friendly and happy to go the extra mile.
"This was simply an amazing experience! From the time I booked the reservation the staff went above and beyond to make our stay here perfect! Guest Relations reached out to see how they could make our stay more enjoyable and if we were there to celebrate anything. Once I told them it was our anniversary they went even more above and beyond and rolled out the red carpet for us and made sure everything was perfect. They gave us a room with phenomenal views of the city, rose petal turn down service and a nice bottle of champagne to celebrate. Everything from check in to check out was perfection and I know I will be staying here again. Keep up the amazing service!"
"Simply, excellent services all the way around. They made me feel welcome and part of the Ritz family. High class amenities, excellent secluded location, in the heart of San Fran. Walking distance to Union Square and all it's attractions. Highly recommend this hotel."
The hotel is situated on top of a hill with Union Square a short and easy walk down hill (about 10 min) but much harder uphill. It was nice feeling removed from the busyness of Union Square (which can be a bit confronting with all of the homeless people living on the sidewalk). The Club was nice to have especially for a quick breakfast. Dinner and lunch options were light however (but still tasty). Room service menu was a little limited.We stayed in a one bedroom suite which was spacious and tasteful (it must of been recently renovated). We brought in two roll away beds for our kids and still had enough room. It was our son's birthday and we received a complimentary birthday cake and goodies which was very nice. Overall a lovely hotel.
"This was by far the worst example of customer service and lack of empathy. I will never stay at another Ritz Carlton property because of how the front desk manager (Agatha) handled my issues. As a Platinum member with Marriott I used miles for my stay. I was taking my mom and partner on a week long trip to Cali for their birthdays. My Mom was turning 80 and had never been to SFO. We arrived after a cancelled and delayed flight Friday around 130am, we asked for an upgrade but were told none were available. Interesting since the next day when I was at the front desk and over heard another customer being offered and upgrade. I also found out that we would not have access to their club. Funny how things changed after I spent several days before our arrival, speaking with the hotel and ensured that everything would be provided. Upgraded room and access to the lounge. Friday morning I spoke to the concierge and expressed my concerns with the room and that the a/c was not working and not having access to their lounge. They sent up a maintenance man to fix the a/c, who was exceptional and should be working at the front desk. His customer service was outstanding. I also received a call from the front desk manager, who gave me some lame excuse for not allowing us access to the lounge. She gave me no options as to how to rectify my issues. She wanted me to come up with options for the customer service issues. She basically lied to me about pretty much everything I asked for, upgrade and making an exception to their lounge. When I told her I was moving to another hotel, she said let me know if I could help. Never did I hear an apology from her or anyone at the front desk. I swear when I was talking to Agatha it sounded like I was talking to a used car sales person. All BS with no substance. Well guess what she lost the sale and I will be sharing this with everyone I know and with the Marriott Platinum Elite folks."
We had a beautiful room that was clean and well furnished. 3 pieces of feedback for management: 1) Get more comfortable couches and chairs 2) provide the service you say you will (promised to pickup shoes for polishing in a few minutes and never showed up) 3) when you transfer a call to an internal hotel business don't charge me for an external call to the internal business without telling me you are doing that.
The Ritz is a classic hotel on top of Nob Hill. So walking back will give you a nice workout. Upon Check--in they were not able to upgrade us despite being SPG Platinum. What was annoying is the front desk attendant then tried to sell us an upgrade. Please don't tell me nothing is available and then try to sell an upgrade. Our room at the end of the corridor was a looooong walk. While rooms have been renovated it seems they tried to save move so they still have the shower/bathtub combo. Rooms are nice but not worth $800 per night. Rooms need to be renovated for this price.
Beautiful hotel well located in SF. Decor on the Lobby and rooms is beautiful. Staff goes out their way to help you out and get what you are looking for. I highly recommend this hotel either for business or leisure.
"My wife and I stayed at the Ritz-Carlton during Fleet Week, and had a fantastic experience. The staff was terrific, and the hotel beautiful. Our experience also included spending time in the lounge, and the staff there was very professional and helpful."
"As I mentioned earlier, I was shocked to see how little being a platinum member for life meant to the front desk / reservations staff. I checked in and they made me feel like they were going out of their way to give me since upgraded room, "
"Having experienced Ritz Carlton hospitality in other cities of the world, I booked there for my first visit to San Fransisco. I was certainly not disappointed! The usual excellent service and punctuality was there and made for a very pleasant stay.I decided to take a room in the club area of the hotel and the care of the attendants and concierges there was outstanding; nothing too hard for them and genuine care for me as a solo traveller. Truly hope to stay there again!!"
"Love this hotel in the heart of Nob Hill. We had a corner room that was well appointed as usual. We had a late checkout and when we tried to get into our rooms it was easily settled. We went to the front desk and our friends had security come up and give them access. Easy peasy, no questions asked, just graciously corrected the error."
"We had a very comfortable stay. The room was generous in size and the bed was very comfortable including down pillows and a down comforter. We enjoyed the oversized chaise lounge and the large TV. We had breakfast in the room each morning and it arrived piping hot and was very good. The bathroom had a tub/shower combo, but was all marble and generous in size. Toiletries are Purple Rain from Asprey. "
"Even it is a rather big hotel, we enjoyed the stay and positive approach from staff and a high quality service. Rooms in line with high expectations, breakfast in line with our family' very high expectations, proactive and personal concierges and a beautiful bar with smooth service. The perfect venue for a week in SAN Fransisco for Pocky travellers."
"We couldn't have been more pleased with our stay. Given it was our 10 year anniversary, the hotel went above and beyond to accommodate us. Top shelf accommodations and staff attention. The staff were incredibly friendly and typical of a Ritz. I love the consistency and glad to know we can expect it from a Ritz. We had an awesome time and if ever back in the area will definitely stay here again."
"Typical beautiful Ritz Carlton w outstanding service. Leonardo at the concierge desk was awesome! He gave us great restaurant recommendations. And, 3 day trolley passes, totally unexpected and very much appreciated! I could tell he really liked his job and it showed. I was also impressed w James, the bellman. He gave us some interesting history of the area and just did an outstanding job. Rachel at the front desk was also a joy. And, that's why I love to stay at Ritz Carlton's. Their staff really makes you feel special. The hotel lobby, restaurant and rooms were all gorgeous. I was upgraded to a corner room w lots of windows. It was really nice. And the location was close to wonderful restaurants and great shopping. I did have an issue w the food in the lounge. Our burgers were supposed to be done medium and both came out charred and very well done. When our server asked how the food was, we told her. She offered to bring us something else but it was late and we just sucked it upand ate because we were tired. She took the burger off the bill and bought us another round of drinks! I wish I remembered her name. She was a lovely person. That's another thing I love about the Ritz. They give their staff the power to make decisions like that. So, what was an unpleasant experience with burgers that were way overcooked was turned into a great one by our server's gesture. I would love to stay at this property again next time I'm in San Fran. I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else."
"Massive modern suite with plenty of space for the family. Excelent front desk staff who resolve any issue. If you take or request Uber, text driver that the hotel is above the Stockton st tunnel- a lot of the drivers end up in the tunnel. Great suv house car that goes in a 1 mike radius."
"Stayed at the Ritz for 3 nights while on business in San Francisco, it is a beautiful hotel, the rooms are nice, modern and clean. The 5 stars is for the service and the staff. They are amazing, friendly and tentative. From the front desk, to the bellman, to housekeeping and restaurant staff. I highly recommend staying there if you are in San Francisco. "
"The service at The Ritz is the best I’ve ever had. They always put the guest first. The employees, service, food, decor, and rooms were impeccable. This was my first stay and definitely won’t be my last! "
I loved my stay at the San Francisco Ritz Carlton! From the moment we drove up to the stately building and were greeted by a valet/doorman in a top hat I felt transported to another world! Our gorgeous room was immaculate and there were chocolate covered strawberries waiting to help us celebrate our anniversary. The decor was perfect and marble floors and countertops in the bathroom were all so luxurious. It all made me feel very special and I would love to return one day!
"Perfect location and excellent hotel. Good service ,rooms were clean,comfortable beds. Excellent valet service and good customer service front desk and reservations. Would recommend to my clients and friends."
"Great location the name says it all up-market, very expensive, lovely decor.Things are over priced, like a pot of coffee to your room. Breakfast was very good but was included in the room price. Go early as not that many tables"
"Staying at a Ritz Carlton is always a good experience. This trip, we chose to stay while spending the night with our 18 month old grandson. The Ritz exceeded all our expectations and could not have been more gracious in making sure both our grandson's and our stay was superb, from the stuffed sea lion and rubber ducky for him to the in room treats for us, the made us feel totally welcome. Breakfast was a treat for all of us and our grandson heartily took of the buffet. The departure backpack filled with goodies and a t S shirt for him was fun, and I enjoyed the help loading the stroller and lots of bags in the back of the SUV. Bravo guys."
Does not have any functional working facilities for business traveler & food sucks for Indian Vegetarian. Even the elevator buttons are old and paint peeled off on half of it. Found it amusing to see such overly priced hotel with such dull decor.
"I loved the location within walking distance from major sites and public transportation. The hotel itself was very nice looking, very clean and had all the amenities you need. The little play area for kids was a nice touch. I also loved that the staff was friendly, helpful and remembered you from one day to the next."
"This is a beautiful hotel in the heart of a great city. The staff are attentive and professional. The food and drinks are excellent. The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. Rooms lack comfortable seating. Depending on location, you may get some noise from outside, but it's not bad. It was a bit odd, but I had some steps after exiting the elevator to get to my room. Not a problem for me, but could be to some. There is no pool and no hot tub - a bit of a disappointment for me. Otherwise the Fitness Center was nice. The Spa also had no availability for the three days I was there. I'm not exactly sure why, they didn't seem all that busy. But, word to the wise, book Spa in advance. The hotel sits on top of a rather large hill. So if you go for a walk around the neighborhood, prepare for the hike back up! Overall, I recommend this property - well worth it!"
"My wife and I stayed at the Ritz-Carlton San Francisco for 3 nights at the conclusion of a weeks stay in the area, including the Monterey Peninsula and Big Sur. From the moment we drove up and were welcomed by a friendly top-hat wearing greeter, we knew it was going to be a special, if not magical experience, which it turned out to be. At check in we were pleasantly surprised to learn we had been upgraded to a club level suite. A special shout out to our bellman, James, who not only brought us and our luggage to our room, but told us about the hotel, our room, the amenities, etc. and made us feel like honored guests. The accommodations were top-notch and beyond our expectations. Pampered luxury personified. From the bedding, electronics, bathrooms, and every other aspect. The condition was immaculate. The Club Lounge was an unexpected surprise--wonderful breakfast, light fare and desserts throughout the day, as well as top shelf alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. The Club Level concierges were there to provide whatever help and assistance they could to their guests. Every staff member we encountered was beyond friendly and truly wanted to meet our every need, and made it a point to greet us by name if they could. Even drivers were offered in lieu of taxis when available which were a godsend given the ""hills"" of SF. Our stay was unbelievable. It has made me a Ritz-Carlton customer---and I hope their other properties can meet these lofty standards."
"My wife and I stayed at the Ritz Carlton San Francisco for our 20th wedding anniversary and we could not be happier with the staff and hotel. The food, service, rooms and atmosphere were exactly what we wanted. Highly recommend!"
I came to SF for a conference. This hotel location was very convenient to shops and restaurants. Prepare to do a lot of walking though. Very clean and beautiful ground as expect from the Ritz. I would stay here again.
My husband decided to celebrate his birthday in San Francisco this year and it was a treat to stay at the Ritz Carlton. From the extremely conscientious and professional staff to the luxury of the dining he was thrilled. We received his favorite bottle of champagne and two glasses in our room upon our arrival and the treats continued for our entire stay. We will certainly return.
Very nice hotel with a great staff. We stayed for one night on our way back to TN from our Honeymoon in Thailand. This was a great stop for relaxation and to wear off the jetlag on our first night back in the US.
"Came to celebrate husbands 50th birthday, thank you for the card and birthday cup cake Hotel is fantasticStayed in a club level room. Offers snacks and drinks throughout the day. Perfect for pre dinner drink or night cap. Rooms are lovely looks like they have been recently up dated. Staff here are so helpful , friendly and knowledgable about local area . Nothing was too much trouble, including setting up banners, balloons etc at breakfast as a surprise for my husband. Great location as close to cable car stop, plenty of cabs outside hotel to hop in too.Highly recommend and would love to return "
"This is our 3rd time staying at the Ritz Carlton - San Francisco. Exceeded our expectations every time.Pros: Conveniently located on top of Nob Hill, Walking distance to ChinaTown/Italian District/Wharf/Union Sq, Excellent Restaurant on site with attentive service. Head Concierge is extremely helpful w/ dining recommendations, Asprey Purple Water bath supplies are phenomenal, comfortable beds, quiet rooms, dark chocolates delivered in the afternoon. Fruit infused waters, fortune cookies and wine served in the lobby...a nice touch!Cons: Can't think of any!"
"The ritz in San Francisco has always been one of our top hotels ranking with plaza athenee in paris and the peninsula in hong kong. We have stayed there about six times and therefore picked it for our anniversary hotel on a one week road trip, We checked in only to be told by an inexperienced front desk clerk that there was a mistake in our reservation and the last day of our stay was cancelled therefore they couldn't honor our deluxe room, club floor assignment even though we had made the reservation two months before and were completely prepaid for the entire reservation..They were very busy that weekend. After demanding to speak to the manager, the clerk reemerged and said good news they were allowing us to have our reservation honored....We were assigned a room, I told them we would meet the bellman in the club lounge and went off to enjoy the club lounge,,only to discover on arrival that we were given club access not club level rooms. We had been downgraded,, Repeat customer, gold ritz carlton member having stayed at four of their hotels this year alone, I was not happy and demanded to see the manager after being told they were saving rooms for other guests coming in, later in the weekend....Eventually we got our room although I am not sure it was the room I paid $1000 per night. The hotel itself has been modernized and looks beautiful although it has lost some charm, The staff friendly, did not remember our names unritz carlton like. It was our only stop during the entire week where we received no anniversary recognition. Offerings at the club level were still great but nothing seemed the same,In deed turndown one night forgotten Good hotel still, but no longer world class ."
"Every aspect of our stay at The Ritz Carlton was superb... Bellmen, front desk , cleaning and service staff could not have been anymore friendly and efficient.. A wonderful experience and will recommend to all !!!"
Every aspect of our stay was delightful and perfect. The hotel was full and yet we were able to be given rooms that met our needs for proximity to elevator. The club lounge 100% met our unusual dietary requirements with grace and generosity. The Ritz is my new favorite hotel in SF. I visit SF often and have tried many hotel chains but this is my favorite by far. Well worth the money. We have stayed without the club lounge and that too was fantastic.
"Amazing stay! We love the lounge. Staff are super professional, kind and going above and beyond for you. In one word our stay was perfect! We loved it and can't wait to come back. They are doing some amazing work in there, having to come across the general manager before our stay due to issues with the reservation, I have to say that I am not surprised. He was nothing but nice, caring and professional. Thank you SF Ritz!"
"This is perhaps my favorite hotel in the USA. The club level experience is superb. We find it difficult to even go anywhere else for food because the presentations throughout the day are that good. Expensive, but worth every penny."
"While it says I live in Atlanta, I'm more like ""from"" Atlanta, only because it's the longest place I've ever lived. Currently, I live and work in Doha, Qatar and mention this so you are aware how far I traveled to get here. Having said that... after 21 hours of flying across the ocean blue from Doha via Hong Kong, a few days in LA and SD, I decided to end my journey in SF. Having stayed at many RCs, recently in Hong Kong, Macau and Kuala Lumpur, I naturally had high expectations of this location. As such, I will say this hotel is beautiful, the Ladies and Gentlemen... professional and courteous from arrival to departure. Nothing fancy this trip, I booked a club level king. The room was VERY large compared to all the other 'basic' king rooms in other hotels, even for a RC. The white and gray colors are MY colors and with the accents of blue were a fabulous touch. The bed was heavenly as usual, and the bathroom equipped with everything you need (or forgot). The club level here is what you would expect for the top RCs. I say this because they aren't all created (or managed) equally. But this one was very nice. Aside from my room being on the level, when you come off the elevator you are greeted by the Ladies and Gentlemen at a level desk which opens up into the level lounge. I liked this as it nearly forced you to notice not only whom would be taking care of you but where you could 'wine' and dine. The food and beverage selections were delicious. As such, having lived in the bay, there was no need for me to go out and try anything else. I was here to stay! BUT... to my disappointment, the in room dining was not to my satisfaction. Granted I had high hopes, I ordered the dim sum, expecting something insatiable as the cuisine I had whilst eating in Hong Kong, Macau and Kuala Lumpur (as I mentioned). While I wasn't expecting Michelin quality Cantonese, and while the concept of having a heating element accompany the steamer was 'cute', I think the operative word is ""heating"" rather than ""cooking"". All to say, it wasn't cooked, enough. But hey, it was a nice try. Overall the stay was good and I will stay here again should I return to the area. "
"What else can you really say about Ritz-Carlton? They essentially create the bar other hotels should be measured against.Every part of this stay was just great. We stayed for 5 days in February.The staff from the valet personnel, to check-in, housekeeping, bar, to restaurant staff were all outstanding. Very professional, very courteous, very attention to detail oriented.This doesn't even need to be a long review. If you are even considering the Ritz-Carlton San Fransisco, stay. You won't be disappointed.If you aren't fancy, the staff will make you feel fancy. If you are, then you already know."
"I love the enterance lobby and the welcome by the staff the service is great and breakfast too was quiet nice, specially the tea box tea options with a wide range of flavours ,but the size and scale of hotel is much smaller compared to other available options around. Had a lovely stay though."
"The attention to details do set this place apart. I received the quality service that is tied to this brand. From the time I got out of the car to the time I left for the airport, I had an amazing time! I didn't even step out of the building from Fri to Sun. This was a weekend work trip and the staff were able to make it a pleasant experience for me. The lobby bar staff were great, the dining room staff were great and the private event staff were great too. My special bar tender Joey was spectacular! Now to the details, the room is beautiful and was cleared of all the feather products before I arrived. I loved the shoe shining service, newspaper delivery and the coffee was delicious. I have never said that about any coffee at any hotels I have stayed in. I usually pass up the in room coffee. I made my own coffee for the first time in years and it was well worth it! The food selections are limited at the hotel bar and the one restaurant. The food and drinks were steep but that is what you can expect while at the Ritz in San Fran. "
This was part of a special trip to San Francisco and the staff at the RC San Fran ensured that our stay was perfect. The room was perfect and everything about the hotel and all staff that we met were perfect. Special thanks to the Guest Relations department who ensured we had a memorable stay. This is the only hotel I will ever stay at in San Fran.
"The service at the Ritz-Carlton in San Francisco was very good. Low-lying without a view, it is very comfortable with well set out rooms of a decent size. It is difficult to figure out value for money as there was significant price variations in the room charge while we were there."
Amazing lobby with two places to eat. The doormen are excellent and friendly . The location can't be beat. Walk everywhere. High Tea is on Sunday. The hotel is also dog friendly. Chinatown is walking distance.
"We checked in on a Wednesday through Friday and then drove up to Napa, came back on Sunday. They knew us by name, Veronica on the Club level made sure we had everything we needed. Robert, was always there to help us with our luggage whether we were coming or going. We received text messages welcoming us and looking forward to our arrival and asking if there was anything we needed in our room before we arrived. We ordered some welcoming champagne and it was waiting in our room and also a dozen white roses that were so fresh and lovely. This Ritz didn't miss a beat. Top notch all the way. Our rooms were spacious and welcoming and exceptionally clean. The most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Thank you Ritz Carlton San Francisco for getting spot on!! Gorgeous city views for sure!"
We checked in for Labor Day weekend and had to wait for our room in the bar. Once the room was ready we entered the best room ever. Totally worth the wait. Staff was over the top kind. The odd thing was the gift shop hours. Went several different times and it was closed. Only thing missing was an opportunity to purchase a quick pastry for breakfast. You had to go to the restaurant and have a long meal or leave the property to run into Starbucks. 
"Great location with an elegant lobby. No platinum benefits (St. Regis gives free breakfast). Room was very comfortable with a great bed. Bathroom was beautiful. Parking is very expensive, but it is SF. Street noise ruined an otherwise nice stay. "
"I had a wonderful stay that happened to occur during my birthday. I received an upgraded room at check-in and was surprised with a delicious mix of birthday desserts an hour later. Two staff members stood out in particular, and I was sure to let the hotel know. They really made me feel special. But really every staff member was attentive, courteous, and responsive - literally at all times, as a matter of course. I did have a few minor mishaps, but they were so promptly and thoroughly addressed that I almost think more highly of the hotel as a result. I will certainly stay again the next time I'm in SF. "
"First stay at a Ritz Carlton, stayed for three nights. Service was generally good, but there was an issue with the room that was not rectified immediately after I had made the request. After waiting an hour, I followed up in person with the front desk and only then did they seem to take any action. Overall, this was a good stay, but for the price of the standard room at over $450 per night with taxes, I expected a little more. Small issues such as our room not being vacuumed, front doormen rushing to open to door for us one minute and just chatting with their mates instead of opening the door the next, having no ""Hotel Guide to Services"" binder in the room -- it just added up to lowering our opinion of what we thought the Ritz-Carlton represented. It is a nice hotel with a super awesome fitness center, complimentary steam room, abundant bottles of water and apples and fortune cookies, finely appointed rooms and a great location. But at the end of the day, the Ritz did not go above and beyond and it just didn't give me the 'Wow' impression to continue my patronage with them. The bottom line is that we had a very good experience with the Ritz, but good is not great and therefore this is not a property we would consider staying at again because the value did not meet the expectations. They just didn't do enough to earn a repeat visit from a first-time customer."
"Dreams do come true at the Ritz. Great location, exceptional service and delicious cuisine. It's a must stay if you are visiting San Francisco. Make sure you book a room with club access. Valet goes above and beyond to meet all your needs."
"The Ritz Carlton/San Francisco is the gold standard. Rooms are large and spacious and they have thought of every conceivable add-on. However, here is where they set themselves apart - the service is simply as good as it gets. This was a family stay and we did choose the club level - again, the gold standard of all club levels. Food was excellent, beverage offerings top-tier and a concierge service ready to cover any request (they got us Giants tickets for 6, in the exact location desired). ALSO, the location of the hotel was perfect - edge of the financial district and one block from China Town. I could go on forever, so I will summarize - if you want the best, look no farter than the Ritz Carlton - San Francisco."
"I recently revisited one of my favorite hotels-The San Francisco Ritz Carlton. It really is a luxury hotel with wonderful rooms and stellar service. The Club Floor is one of the best I have ever experienced with very helpful staff and excellent presentations throughout the day, especially breakfast. What really sets this hotel apart is the first rate staff, always so willing to assist in any way. I am already looking forward to a return visit, next time with my spouse."
"We loved this hotel from the moment we walked into reception. We were greeted with Champagne & Cold Towels. The check-in was perfect and very informative. Our room was modern, clean and smelt beautiful. It was our 20th wedding anniversary and when we got back to the hotel that evening they had left us a card and a bottle of bubbles, such a lovely gesture. Loved the running station in the foyer every morning with cold water & towels to greet you back, also loved the early morning coffee station.Buffet breakfast was fab and the ladies were really friendly. One afternoon we had lunch in the foyer restaurant/bar and it was excellent. I wasn't sure which Rose' I wanted so the waitress brought me over two taster glasses so I could make my choice :-) We will definitely return to this amazing hotel the next time we are back in SF."
"Our daughter's wedding was held at the Ritz-Carlton in San Francisco. Staff are genuinely friendly and eager to help. Facility was beautiful, and food was much closer to fine dining than mass-produced."
not a luxury property -- no pool -- bs spa--front desk has attitude --- food sucks---only good experience was concierge & hotel drivers-- stay at the st regis or the fairmont ---the hotel should be under Ritz nameplate 
"Nice property. Well appointed and spacious rooms on Club Level, which is typical for almost every Ritz I've been to. Excellent service in Club, too. Valet is crazy expensive, which I knew ahead of time and was fine with -- but the long waits getting the car after calling ahead was ridiculous and not okay for the cost. Huge complaint and almost enough to make this a three star review. Almost. We would stay here again but we will Uber next time."
"Received a room on the second floor across from the busy foyer to the Ballroom. COuldn't open the curtains, and checked in the room with pillows on the floor and half drank water bottles throughout. Am platinum and paid (not reward stay), and was denied use of a Club Level upgrade because I booked from the app when I rushed to the plane due to family emergency - and not allowed or offered access through payment. I did receive free upgraded internet which speed was just over dialup. I moved to the Four Seasons and was treated like a KING! Suggestion - ditch the rewards program - it is an insult - I have NEVER ONCE got a room upgrade at move than 3 years at Platinum."
"The SF Ritz is a great place to stay- coming back to the historic Nob Hill property each time during our stay elicited multiple “welcome backs” by the staff that appear to know each guest staying at the hotel. The service was terrific throughout and the concierge was very helpful and knowledgeable of events going on locally. The room was large and very well laid out with a marble bathroom. I used Amex’s FHR program to make the booking that gave us free breakfast, wifi, late check-out and other benefits. Both the breakfast and the bar/lounge was excellent. Finally, the Ritz scores on one of my pet peeves at upper end hotels- free bottled water and coffee/tea in the room. Overall the best hotel I have stayed at in San Francisco."
"Gorgeous historic building in great area of San Fran- and overall 5 star experience. Staff was also terrific and first class. Unfortunately- the club floor, which we heard was awesome, was sold out- but still had a wonderful stay"
"Just completed 3 nights at the Ritz Carlton SF with my wife. We had an amazing time. The staff was impeccable from the doormen to the front desk. We celebrated an anniversary and babymoon as my wife is almost 9 months pregnant and the welcome gift was a cherry on top of a great stay. Can't wait to come back! For people like me who like to shop, the hotel is a short less than 10 minute walk to union square. The hotel is in a very safe area and is just around the corner from China town for some fun walking. "
"This is a beautiful building at the top of a huge hill in San Francisco. Service was impeccable - exactly what you expect from a Ritz. Rooms are a really good size, hotel is really quiet - only exception was a big party in the courtyard that had a band but thankfully they stopped playing at 10pm. Would stay here again!"
We celebrated our 10th year wedding anniversary at the Ritz Carlton San Francisco. The hotel staff decorated our bed with rose petals and gave us chocolate covered strawberries and a nice card. All the staff were very professional and accommodating and helpful. We really enjoyed our stay and highly recommend this place. 
"Fantastic trip. As expected, a warm welcome, beautiful room, supremely comfortable bed and superb service. Club level employees, notably Nicolas, Veronica, Joachin and Vicky, were wonderful. Having been to the Ritz Aruba in April, in a way, I was disappointed with the offerings, particularly for children, but my wife reminded me of the market and that is business, of the hotel. We had a great time. Highly recommend. "
"Our front desk check in was really great--we came very early and had bags, and they offered us a choice of an upgraded room with a wait, or the room we had booked immediately. We choose the upgrade, and it was worth it-- huge room, very nice amenities. The restaurant was good, and service was pretty good overall.Our location was really very central for us (next to financial district), and its walking distance to chinatown. They said they had a car service, which we didn't use. Overall, a very nice stay."
"Located just a short walk from Union Square and in the heart of the city, the Ritz offers exceptional accommodation that is a true sanctuary in the hustle and bustle of SF. Amazing rooms, the best hotel service, great restaurant, and perfect location. Well worth the stay."
Superb customer service and a great professional atmosphere. This was a quick two day business trip and I enjoyed staying at the Ritz in SF with my wife. I will go back there again. Great overall experience.
"We stayed at the Ritz San Francisco for a business conference. It is a wonderful place for a conference! It makes having to work a pleasure! The service received during the conference was exceptional. The assistance we received while enjoying a little personal time after the conference was more than I could have asked for. From suggestions on restaurants to evening activities and assistance with a rental car, the service provided was fantastic."
The hotel staff at the Ritz Carlton made the experience so much more than just a very nice hotel to stay in. I would recommend staying at this Ritz-Carlton if you are looking for a very nice place to stay while visiting San Francisco.
"Loved my stay! The room was well equipped with water, snacks and the Nespresso machine is fabulous! The bed was wonderful and the view from my room was outstanding. It was close enough to China Town and Little Italy and Pier 39 too."
Four adults and it was superb! Wonderful rooms. Awesome amenities. A very helpful concierge. I want this to become my go to hotel for sure! It was spectacular. The building is beautiful and staff is entirely competent
"The hotel looks awesome. The decor is great and feels really nice. We had the choice of two double beds for my wife and son with a nice 'view' or a king size bed with a single bed without a view. In a moment of stupidity I chose the room with a view. It turns out that the 'view' was of a set of traffic lights and the windows were single glazed. Meaning that when someone stopped at the traffic lights you could hear what track they were playing.We had a catalogue of issues with tickets for Alcatraz which is a whole new story which was eventually sorted out by ric Lee the chief concierge. He is a class act and changed our mind about how we felt about the hotel, be it only an improvement of total rubbish up to 'ok'."
"I stayed here for two nights for business. The hotel lived up to its reputation for service. From the moment my Uber dropped me off I was met by hotel staff who went above and beyond to make sure I had everything I needed, whether it was help getting my bag up to my room, bottled water, a warm total to refresh with, or other countless offers they made to make my stay great. The room was beautiful- I had a standard king bed and the chaise was really nice (big enough to sleep on). I think each room must have dual sinks, and I also thought the Nespresso machine was a nice touch. The only negative is that I had a room facing the courtyard and usually when I stay in SF I have a beautiful view of the city, so would suggest requesting that if possible (I did not)."
"Wonderful hotel for a vacation with elderly mother and in-laws. Accommodations were perfect for everyone, with rooms located right next to each other. Hotel had services to accommodate everyone's diet and needs. Everything seems to be anticipated."
"Had a meeting at the hotel. Very nice indeed. Great location, walking distance from China town and Little Italy. My room was not vacuumed when I checked in, and once I called, the problem was quickly rectified and I had a hand written apology from the housekeeping manager. I would definitely stay there again "
"Not only amazing while we were visiting they were also helpful prior to our visit. I called to speak with the concierge to do some planning prior to the trip. They took my call and helped me put the pieces together of what we should do while there. Also, dinner at the hotel was amazing! Food was excellent and so was the service. From beginning to end everything was amazing! "
"Enjoyed a fun get away to San Francisco staying at the beautiful Ritz Carlton on Stockton. Centerally Located to Union Square and China Town as well as the Ferry Building. Room was very comfortable as expected from a Ritz. Staff accommodating to remove items from the honor bar refrigerator so we could stock with some of our own items. Loved the comfortable beds, plush towels and robes. Used Marriott Points for this stay and it worked out great !"
"I took two nieces (23 and 13) on a trip to SF for a long weekend. We had 2 adjoining rooms on the concierge floor, and all of us left feeling like we had been treated like royalty. Rudy worked on the concierge floor. Rudy made our trip. He is a recent transfer with the company from the Mayflower in DC where we reside. We bonded with Rudy over restaurants we like in DC, and the rest is history. We found places we would have never found thanks to his suggestions. Nora was terrific in the housekeeping department. She made my nieces feel like princesses by arranging their makeup and toiletries! Nicholas helped us find a great tour of the Meir Woods. All and all the staff is remarkable here. I've stayed at several other Ritz properties. All our nice. However the Ritz SF defines the brand for me and sets the standard!"
i stayed in a suite and it was phenominal. The room was emmaculate. The bathroom was stocked with every item you could think of. The bar and restaurant on site served delicious food. The staff was courteous and helpful.
"Perfect hotel for a 3 night city break. Ideal location, very family friendly. Main bar very nice with friendly and knowledgeable staff. Staff throughout hotel amazing. Spa beautiful, very well equipped gym. Highly recommend."
"Fantastic hotel. Hotel staff were excellent! My overall experience was excellent. Next time I go anywhere there is a Ritz I will be staying there. From the valet parking, to the rooms, the lounge, restaurant and all the hotel staff my experience was incredible."
"Stayed at the Ritz Carlton for 4 nights during my trip to SF this past May. Got a great deal (So for the price paid, deserves 4 stars) and loved the location and room space. But wouldn't pay ""full"" price given less than 5 star service.Pros: Loved the location (right between Chinatown and Union Station), which was perfect for our needs. Trolley right by hotel too.Double Queen room was VERY spacious for SF. Loved the decor and comfy chaise in the room (chaise can easily be a bed for a child or maybe an adult) Great toiletries (Asprey) and housekeeping was fantastic (unobtrusive and very prompt)Food was great too (we had room service and the service was great) plus free bottles of water, apples and occasional free afternoon ""SF fog"" drink. Oh and a large container of fresh fortune cookies in the lobby. Front desk was great and prompt with any questions. They also always greeted us as we walked by.Hotel doesn't have a pool but has a great spa and gym area. Am Marriott Gold and received 4pm late checkout which was great! Cons:Arrived around 9pm in an uber and no doorman or bellhop was there to greet us or help with luggage. By the time our uber driver retrieved our luggage, the doorman and front staff came back, but only offered to open the door. No assistance whatsoever was offered to help us with our luggage. Did not expect this from a 5 star hotel.At first, were never told of a house car but I'd read about it online and on hotel's site. Asked the concierge (front desk was busy checking ppl in/out) on my way out of the lobby and was told, ""I'm not sure, check with the valet about car service"". We go outside and there are 3 valet guys standing to the side chatting with each other, completely ignoring us as we walk out and wait on the sidewalk. We stand awkwardly waiting to be acknowledged. Finally, one of them comes over and ask if they can help. We ask about the house car as we only wanted to go about 7 blocks (its hilly sis didn't want to walk it). We are told the car is out and it'll be 15-20 min and taking an uber may be better. Then he leaves without really waiting for us to respond. At this point, we just decided to uber. We thought it was bad luck/timing so try again the next day to catch the house car to get a hair cut about 10 min away(around 9:40 on a Sat for a 10 am appt). Again, was told no house car available and no other offer to help. He goes back to chatting with his co-workers. Not a big deal to spend the $8 for the ride, but the hotel shouldn't proclaim that they have house car service if they don't want to provide this service or make the customer feel like they are asking for a huge favor. I also understand that this service may be limited, given demand/timing, but the valet/front door staff should be more helpful in providing information/options (instead of chatting with each so much) and less dismissive to customers.There was an AIG conference happening during our stay so some parts of the hotel as well as the lobby/lounge area were restricted and/or packed with AIG employees so that wasn't the most ideal. We also received an AIG gift bag by accident (filled with a framed employee photo) on the desk by inside our room one evening. Note - We went to the Sunday brunch at the Top of the Marks hotel (believe it was around 90-100 pp). Not worth it. I've had much bette for a lot less. Food was OK, but variety/quality wasn't there for that $$$. Views were good though as we expected. Skip it!"
"Traveled here for a conference and was not disappointed. Location is spectacular and service is exactly what you would expect at the Ritz. Room was a clean and modern, however due to my last minute booking I had an inner looking courtyard view. Lobby bar is great and I look forward to my next stay here."
"Clean and respectable hotel. The breakfast was good and the buffet was fresh. Check in was easy, but if I stayed again would ask for a room closer to the lift as it felt like a trek to get to my room. "
"Stayed here recently on the end of a two week+ vacation hiking the national parks in Northern California. It was also my 50th birthday.Upon arrival we were greeting by the valets and bellman - all very polite, professional and friendly. Quite a welcome I must say. Checking in was great as well. Hotel lobby is gorgeous as is the rest of the property Our room #733 was fantastic - so spacious, comfortable and many amenities throughout. The bed was unbelievably comfortable! Shower and bathroom were excellent as well. I didn't want to leave the room! The service is what really made our stay special from little touches everywhere like filling our ice bucket each night to bottles of water for our car ride to airport. The level of professionalism without being obtrusive is incredible. Loved our entire stay and was sad to goHighly recommend this hotel experience "
"Wife and I stayed at this centrally located RC property after wrapping up a 5 night Napa Valley trip. We have been fortunate to have stayed at several RC brand hotels over the years and our decision to book with the RC SF brought us the perfect end to an amazing week of wine, food, and wonder.The hotel can surprise you on first approach since the hills of the surrounding area can mask so much but suddenly on approach you pull into a lovely main entrance well staffed with some of the most professional door and valet team I have ever experienced. We were dropping the rental car off in town so the valet team efficiently unloaded our gear and got us ready for check in very quickly and kept the car out front for us so it would be easy to recover come time to take it down to the drop off site. Reception was fast and easy and as always in our stay with RC, marked by the 'welcome back home' demeanor we have come to love in our decision to stay with RC for our lux travels.Reception was wonderful and easy, as hoped and expected after a two-hour drive in Friday traffic, and the front desk staff were among the most friendly and efficient I have had the pleasure of meeting in a long time.Main entrance delivers on the expected RC fresh flowers and the lounge right there at reception brings to mind the sister property at Watertower in Chicago.Out service at the RCSF was impeccable from the moment we pulled into the property to the time we sat down in our car to the airport the following day.My overall scoring of the service we experienced at this property:Bell Staff / Valets 10+Check In staff 10+Front Desk 10+Bar / Lounge 10+Restaurant 10+Housekeeping 10+We briefly mentioned to our check-in team it was our anniversary and to our joy, when we got back from dinner housekeeping had prepared a wonderful surprise for us in our room.The hotel is just a few minutes ride by car to all the city center attractions, but at the same time, provides a quite respite from all the SF chaos if you feel the need.The RCSF is headed up by an amazing management team of Mr Tabish Siddiquie, and GM Bruce Gorelick, both of whom I had the pleasure of interacting with on this stay. As has been my experiences with all RC properties in the past, the RCSF was a warm, welcome, and luxurious shelter in the storm of SF activity and we very much look forward to our next stay.Highly Recommended"
"We stayed at the Ritz before the 4th of July. The valet, check-in is all just as expected at a Ritz. Nice. The service through out our stay was very nice and with no reason to complain.Bar: We had some visitors, a family with kids. We had drinks at the bar as the lounge/restaurant was closed at that time. The waitress was very nice to every one (including those who only had nonalcoholic beverages). what a contrast to the bad experience I had at St. Regis in Princeville. Rooms: You will not have great views from the hotel rooms here. However, you will not miss the views either because the rooms are so well furnished and kept. I would rate them five start for size, ambience and luxury.I had an electric vehicle. They charged it while it was at the valley parking. Nice gesture. Thank you!!They offered hot coffee, water bottle, towels for our early AM weak/jog/whatever at the bell desk. Again, a very nice touch for the outdoorsy people.Some fine establishments could occasionally go wrong some where. Not here at the Ritz in San Francisco. I will gladly recommend to any one and including those with families. Great place!!"
"Best hotel in SF! Service, decor and location are the best. If you can afford to try and stay at the club level, but if not, you still won't be disappointed. It is good for family as well as a special occassion - which is what we try and do several times a year. They make your stay a wonderful experience"
"Great place to stay in the city. Location is great with easy access to Chinatown and Union Square and beyond. Rooms are lovely and well appointed with comfortable beds. And quiet! The staff was, well, The Ritz Carlton. Very attentive and helpful."
We stayed in a Club level room for 6 nights. The room was very comfortable and spacious with a luxurious bathroom. The food and drink selections in the Club lounge were always beautifully presented and of a consistently high quality. The desserts in the evening were always extra special as was the presentation of the fruit at breakfast. The staff were always attentive to just the right level. They didn't grab your plate as soon as you had finished but seemed to know the right time to step in and remove things. Dishes were replenished before things ran out so availability of items was never a problem. The concierges were always friendly and efficient as were the door staff and hotel driver. The location was great too. I highly recommend this hotel for a stay in San Francisco.
"I'm not usually one to pick up on tired décor or places that look like they're well heeled, however when you go to a Ritz property you don't expect this to be an issue, unfortunately it was in this case. Firstly the service throughout the visit was second to none, they couldn't do enough for us the staff were great, but that's where the positives stopped for me. Breakfast was a disappointment, very little selection at the buffet although all well cooked, but very expensive for what it was. The rooms although perfectly clean were a bit of a let down, quite dark and boring if you ask me, which is fine if all the lines are clean cut but its just masking an old tired building, and it obvious throughout the property. From the outside the place is stunning unfortunately just not replicated on the inside. And lastly, paying for wifi?? in this day and age at a Ritz property when you're paying enough for a room as it is I think is terrible. We found the location good enough to explore the city from and had no trouble sleeping at all."
"Visited the R-C for a meeting, which occurred over my birthday.There were rose petals strewn on the bed and a bottle of bubbly with a plate of chocolate dipped strawberries greeted us as we walked in.Yes, my spouse had let them know it was my birthdayBut no, nothing had been planned or requested.The hotel was as Ritzy as the R-C should be. Clean, quite, luxurious."
"Since my wife and I met in San Francisco, we wanted to spend our 25th wedding anniversary there, too. We invited our daughter from New York and our son and his wife from South Carolina to join us and booked three rooms on the Ritz Carlton Club Lounge level. The service throughout the hotel was exceptional, from the hotel concierge who handled many anniversary-related requests to the Club Level concierge who made us feel completely at home throughout our stay. It was a remarkable few days and the perfect way to celebrate such a special occasion in our lives. We highly recommend it to anyone who wants to feel special!"
"Have stayed here a number of times, and always stay in The Club Level Suites.This is a wonderful Hotel, has a great gym and spa. On The Club Level, The Concierge staff are amazing. they will do anything for you, and the food is wonderful."
The Ritz offers some of the best customer service out there. I have stayed at many properties around the U.S. and are never disappointed with the hotel or the service they provide. It is in a great safe location for SF and easily accessible to all different parts of town. We mostly traveled by uber's and coming back here at the end of walking those hills was a relieve
Our family went to the Ritz Carlton San Francisco for a very special birthday long weekend. The location is perfect near the best shopping in Union Square and Chinatown. The hotel is a classic beautiful maintained. The staff are amazing attending to our every need. We really like stopping at the bar each evening before heading out to one of San Francisco's finest restaurants. For breakfast each morning the gourmet buffet was delicious. This hotel is perfection!!We look forward to our next visit. 
"Hotel is still trying to look elegant but its all but impossible to upgrade a dated hotel. Room decor and amenities are below even Best Western standards...speaking of which, at least BW has a fairly okay complimentary buffet breakfast. Ritz has an expensive rudimentary breakfast.Staff does try its best to make the stay comfortable but what can they do when the rooms have no built in fridge or microwave? Just offer to squeeze in one in a corner of the small room, I guess!! oh well."
"Promised a quiet interior room, instead given a room with massive cooling system fans outside the window which generated constant whining noises. Second room had malfunctioning ventilation which only blew extremely hot air (it was summertime) and which required a maintenance visit. Very disappointing overall."
"The Ritz Carlton in SF is an exceptional hotel. Beautiful rooms. Clean. Great maid service. All of the services offered were exceptional. Close to the Sauce restaurant, one of our favorites! We would not hesitate to stay there again."
The hotel is centrally located. Very elegantly decorated. Food was extremely good and staff was so friendly and smiling all the time. Rooms were spacious and the hotel has lot of reasturants and bars. Bit expensive but great value compared to other hotels in the area. 
This was my second visit to San Francisco and I would recommend the hotel. Lovely hotel and very impressive and would definitely use the hotel again if ever I get back to San Francisco. Great location 
"I stayed 5 nights while in tow. For a conference and was thoroughly impress with the details. The only disappointment was that there was no upgrade available at check in but while it's a benefit of AMEX Platinum, it isn't guaranteed to be available, maybe next time. I was impressed that every member of the team remembered my name every day and inquired about my day and how my stay is going. They earned a solid 5stars for my 5 day stay."
We are Ritz Carlton Owners and we feel like being as a family when we stay other Ritz Carlton hotels. Definitely that makes us to stay at Ritz Carlton hotel more than any other hotels in every locations we go. 
"Our stay was excellent from beginning to end. We utilized the spa and the hotel car to take us to destinations within a mile or two of the hotel, which was very helpful. Each staff member we encountered was genuine and helpful."
"Awsome hotel, Awsome staff.Great location.. When ever I get to San Fran. This is the place I always stay.. Rooms are a nice size, it's very clean the most professional and courteous staff any where in the bay area."
A lovely place to stay. Stayed for business but noticed it was kids friendly as well. Easy check in and out. Great location. Places and restaurants to easily walk to. I used the bar one night and it was very cosy with a good wine list by the glass.
"We used our Mariott Points to stay here for two nights - upon arriving we were able to upgrade to a suite on the club level for a reasonable price. All we can say is even at double the price this hotel was amazing and a great way to start off our romantic escape from New York! Before arriving the concierge made contact to see if there was anything special they could do for us. We informed them it was our anniversary and would like fruit and drinks upon arrival. We have stayed at other Ritz-Carlton but this one really deserves to be a six-star hotel! upon arrival, the lobby is full of gorgeous flowers setting the tone for the luxurious room we were given. If you can get a room with access to the club - splurge it's definitely worth it. The food presented at all times of the day was delicious and there is a concierge to greet you upon stepping off the elevators. When we returned from dinner our first night there were rose petals on the bed - romantic details that were appreciated. The hotel rooms are very nicely decorated and spacious. We would definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel very highly! Thank you Ritz for making this a very romantic stay."
"No surprises here, suburb service, exceptional rooms, friendly staff. We especially love the concierge floor. Consider this next time you book a room as you have great food included in price and beats going out which can ultimately save you $$."
"This hotel is a five star based on location, the beauty of the hotel itself and the attention to detail by the staff.. The front desk commented that they were expecting me earlier in the day which was true. The valet asked if he could clean out my car from our road trip which shocked and pleased me. I really appreciate that attention to detail."
"Came to the city for an annual ""back to school shopping spree"" with my son. We live locally so it's always fun to play ""tourist"" in your own backyard! We took the Ferry in to the city from Sausalito and walked up to the Ritz. It's a short walk (uphill). Check-in was efficient and friendly, appreciated the warm towels! Our room was large and comfortable and overlooked the street. It was a quick downhill walk to the shops at Union Square and Market Street. We slept well and enjoyed a nice breakfast the next morning at the hotel. Love the complimentary kombucha shots :) Overall, it was a good experience. Hint! There is NO pool - should have done my research on that ahead of time! Staff were polite when approached, but nobody really showed the service that the Ritz is known for at other properties. "
Much work is needed by the City of San Francisco and the Ritz in Nob Hill to make it a return destination. The city is full of trash; homeless everywhere; drug infested; and super crowded with disappointed tourists. The Ritz is located in a deteriorating section of town - Nob Hill. The city and hotel are living and clinging to fading memories of good decades long past.
"I have stayed at many five star hotels in San Fran this year. I keep coming back to the Ritz because I prefer the location on Nob Hill versus the intense street hustle around the Four Seasons and the St Regis. The Ritz rooms are spacious and the bathrooms luxurious. I always sleep very well at this hotel (note: thin walls at the Fairmont are a deal breaker for me). However, this is not a ""view"" hotel. I have had rooms on this ""mid hill"" location that have fine city views but most do not have much of a view because the historic structure is squatty and was not originally built for views. Also, because this hotel is a retrofit the room layout can also require quite a hike from the elevator to your room. The bar area is very nice to my eye and the attention to detail in how the lounge is decorated, drinks are served and how fast bar nibbles hit the marble table in front of you is quite satisfactory. The dining room is fine for breakfast but I seldom eat in a hotel provided option when there are so many better options around town. The only downside I experienced this trip was a very late delivery on room service breakfast. Everything arrived cold and I had to dine and dash to make my business meeting. The hotel declined (without me asking) to charge me for breakfast. But still, not five star service."
"This is a beautiful old hotel in an excellent location in the Financial District. The public spaces are nice, the restaurant is terrific, and my room was large, extremely comfortable and immaculate. I had sufficient outlets, good work space, and the wifi signal was strong. Service was excellent too."
"We booked the Ritz Carlton months ago, which I now seriously regret. We're paying $600 a night for service that falls short of that you'd expect in a travel lodge in the uk. Note to Marriott hotels I object to being a member of your laughingly called loyalty scheme when I check in am offered an upgrade if I pay an additional $200. I always ask for a quiet room and am give. the room after the elevator so I enjoy the noise of every other guest walking past my room. Reception said there are only another 14 rooms past yours so should be ok. I requested a high floor and was put on 3rd floor and again told I could pay more for an upgrade . We asked for a kettle , tea and milk which was provided , we returned to the room today, milk not refreshed, mugs not replaced (we had paper mugs - really - at $600 a night !!!! paper mugs - have I checked into Starbucks? ) We rang to ask for milk and China mugs and more breakfast tea as this too hadn't been refreshed , room service turned up with orange chamomile tea, cream and more paper mugs - I honestly cannot believe this is the Ritz Carlton , if I'd have wanted this level of service I'd have booked into The Courtyard by Marriott . Years ago our company ran a management training course which used the Ritz Carlton values to exemplify customer service values - well all I can say is you seriously need to revisit what you stand for, as your staff are not delivering your values. On top of this the illuminated mirror wasn't working, the hairdryer had no nozzle, the shower control only half works when you pull the nozzle up so you end up with the bath tap washing your feet and weak power from the shower . I do not expect to come on holiday and spend my time ringing reception, housekeeping etc just to get the basics right. Thankfully I've booked four seasons for my next stop in Vancouver but I have booked the Ritz Carlton in Toronto and based on service here I intend to ask my travel agent to change our booking . You only get once chance to make a good impression - massive fail . "
Spent last Thanksgiving there and really enjoyed the entire experience. The lobby is elegant and the room has been refreshed in a more contemporary design. The location is amazing close to Chinatown and Union Square.
"My wife, our daughter, and I enjoyed our week at the RCSF. Our one bedroom suite was large, comfortable, nicely furnished and decorated, quiet, and clean. Every member of the staff was friendly, professional, and competent. The hotel is beautiful and nicely located--within walking distance of Chinatown and Union Square's shopping district--complete with invigorating walks back up Nob Hill. We enjoyed daily afternoon drinks in the bar, and breakfasts at the restaurant, Parallel 37, were irresistible. (We'd planned to eat elsewhere every morning, but decided their breakfasts would be hard to beat.) All agreed our next SF visit would be to the RCSF."
"First I have to say, I am a huge fan of the Ritz Carlton brand and have stayed in many of their properties. I love the customer service, the atmosphere, everything. So having said that, something was just . .. off with this property. Yes, the staff was nice and helpful, for the most part. But it somehow lacked the warmth and verve of other properties. We stayed on club level, which is always a favorite part of the Ritz experience for me. The first suite we were given was a huge disappointment and to their credit, the front desk quickly came to show us two other choices. I understand that the building is an old bank and so some of the layout is awkward, but it was odd to have a bedroom with no window. I had called the hotel the day before we arrived to be sure that the doors between the bedroom and living room were solid wood, with no window, so that a TV in the living room wouldn't disturb anyone trying to sleep in the bedroom. Yes, they assured me, solid wood doors. But when we arrived? Glass. Thank goodness for Amazon Prime - I had blackout curtains the next day. But a black mark for the Ritz. That is not a hard question and for a light sleeper like myself, it's an important one. THAT'S WHY I CALLED TO ASK.And you're the Ritz. You should get that right. They also stock only Pepsi products in the club lounge, which is an abomination. The staff was great about keeping a stash of Diet Coke for me in the back. And kudos to the club level concierges for lots of help with our requests. Yet, nobody really went above and beyond, as they have at other Ritz properties where we've stayed. No friendly gestures to our son. For a Ritz, it was fairly basic and once off club level it all felt so . . .perfunctory. I think if we returned to San Francisco, I would stay elsewhere and frankly, I am both surprised and saddened by that. I almost feel like a good friend has let me down. I know, I know . . .it's just a hotel. But I always look forward to the hotel as much as the rest of the trip, when it's a RC. This time, however, the city was fantastic. The hotel was . . . okay."
"It used to be that staying at the Ritz carlton meant staying at a beautiful hotel with exceptional service and guest that viewed it as a special occasion to stay at such a luxurious hotel. Most, not all, save up their money to stay in a Ritz Carlton and want everything to be perfect but now you show up and the hotel is full of guests wearing flip flops, denim shorts, pajama bottoms and slipper in the lobby."
"Our family truly enjoyed our stay. The staff went out of its way to make us feel comfortable and important. The location at the top of Nob Hill is beautiful, but if walking is planned make sure you're in great shape!"
What a fantastic treat! Great views and lovely suite. As a Platinum member we felt special. We stayed with a few friends from out of town and had a blast. It was a big slumber party and we will do it again.
"My husband and I stayed here during the end of May for one night to celebrate our 20th anniversary. During our stay, he had a medical emergency and was up most of the night in severe pain. In our rush the next morning to leave the hotel, I didn't realize I left behind a pair of very expensive shoes - it will cost over $1200 to replace them. Upon our return we both had medical complications to deal with, a kid's 18th birthday party to throw, two kids graduations, and getting ready for a relocation to Switzerland end of August - I didn't notice until today (a little over 2 months later) the shoes were missing. I contacted the hotel, and they had logged in their computer system that the shoes had been left. However, they told me that after 30 days they donate the items. I explained that I NEVER RECEIVED A COURTESY CALL, EMAIL OR TEXT from the hotel at any time to notify me I had left the shoes. They told me it was corporate policy for ""privacy"" reasons not to do so. I cannot think of one single legitimate reason not to notify a customer they left an expensive item behind. The manager told me ""lots of customers leave behind items"" and it was not her fault it was corporate policy and she was ""just the middle man"" and that loss prevention was in charge. She also told me I had no expectation of any sort of compensation (especially since I had left the shoes ""way back in May""). This was totally ridiculous treatment on the part of management and it is not an unreasonable expectation for a hotel the caliber of the Ritz Carlton to send a courtesy notice to its guests they have left someone of value behind, especially before they donate the items to charity. If they can take the time to log it into their system, they can easily contact the guest at the same time. A defensive posture on the part of management unwilling to take any responsibility was not appreciated. This was such a frustrating, disappointing experience, and I will be staying at the Four Seasons, where guests are treated with much more care and respect!"
"We can probably thank the Ritz-Carlton for making our vacation. Okay, so the room was beautiful. Stunning views, excellent beds, everything expected. What wasn't expected, was the out of this world service. Somehow, they upgraded us to the club level at no extra expense. We spent several nights and mornings there. Relaxing, talking to the staff, and enjoying the delectable food. One night, while scanning the dessert buffet, I asked a staff member if anything was dairy free (I can't have milk, unfortunately) She went to check with the chef, and reported back with a sad 'no'. But she brought out a bowl of fresh berries for me and promised that there would be a dairy free dessert the next night. In the morning, the breakfast foods had labels of whether the food had dairy or not. I never intended it to be a big deal, but the Ritz Carlton took the kindness and consideration to make sure I felt welcome and comfortable. Truly the perfect hotel. I loved it."
"Everyone should experience this type of customer care at least once in their life. It was wonderful from the first hello from the doormen to the last goodbye from the Lounge. Eric at the front desk, was wonderful and helpful. He is a future GM! He handles every situation with aplumb. Savanna, also at the front desk, always had a warm smile and helped us get around town. My children were greeted by their names the day we checked in. There were wonderful little surprises waiting for them in our room. Parallel 37 also was lovely; big thank you to Luis and James. Luis found oatmeal for our daughter long after breakfast was done. It's the little touches that go a long way. Eric, in the lounge, was a lovely and we had his services twice during our stay (thank you for the potato beignets). The concierge arranged for a later check out time due to our Muir Woods tour. Everyone was so thoughtful and showed us great care. No doubt, this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."
I had the opportunity to stay at the Ritz Carlton in San Francisco with Club access. The hotel has a more modern feel and has been recently remodeled. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Staff in the club were very professional and knowledgeable about the area.
"We received very little attention- asked for ice never record, out of expresso on room never record, wrong directions to room. No mention of the hotel amenities at all. Had to leave hotel to be treated in a caring attentive manner. Room was noisy, windows allowed street noise / cable car noise no one cared.I have stayed at hundreds of hotels and I was VERy VERY dis appointed please call me 530 867 4992"
From check in to breakfast to working out always a pleasant experience. The room was comfortable and very well kept. The bell staff was very helpful always offering directions and making sure the car was in front when requested. Use of the complementary car service was a real savior after a long day of site seeing. The driver was friendly and offered historical information we found fascinating. This was our second visit and will not be our last. Overall a really great stay.
"This hotel is in a great location and it's so inviting once you walk in the doors. The guest rooms are so comfortable. Room service was very tasty and delivered in a timely manner. In my opinion, Ritz Carlton is always a brand that you can count on."
"Superb room, attentive staff, excellent food and drink, great location, very nice meeting space - everything 100%. Bar had creative tasty cocktails, the waitstaff were very helpful, catered food for meetings was excellent (can't beat the bacon), had NY Times and Wall Street Journal delivered every day, room was extraordinariy quiet (felt like we were the only ones in the hotel), fitness center had perfect number of aerobic machines with mats, balls, rollers, water bottles, apples, and TVs that actually worked."
"We celebrated our 21st wedding anniversary at the Ritz-Carlton and couldn't have been more pleased. From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel so special. Unbelievable customer service with warm and friendly staff throughout the hotel. My wife wish we could give this hotel and extra star because they deserve it. Thank you all at the Ritz for making our special day even more special. We will never forget our stay with you. "
My wife and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary and our stay at the Ritz-Carlton could not have been any better. The staff was extremely hospitable and the service was absolutely impeccable. You can be sure that if we come back to San Francisco - which is quite likely - that we'll again stay at the Ritz-Carlton. It was truly that special!
"Impeccable service, grand surroundings and attention to detail make this a wonderful place to stay. We were celebrating our anniversary and were spoiled with a corner suite, chocolate covered strawberries and rose petals on the bed at turn down. "
"We stayed in the Ritz Carlton SF for 1 night while on our way to Napa. Being a Ritz Carlton, the hotel, lobby, restaurant, and room were, of course, all beautiful. The nicest amenity was the Club Level floor, which offered gourmet-quality breakfast, snacks, hors d’oeuvres, and refreshments throughout the day. The staff was incredibly helpful and courteous. The hotel is located within steps of China Town, Little Italy, Fisherman’s Wharf and Ghirardelli Square."
"My friends and I had a lovely stay at the Ritz San Fran. My friend was turning 50 and we stayed at the Ritz for just one night before driving to Napa. The hotel surprised us with a bottle of champagne to toast her birthday. Lovely hotel, very warm and friendly staff."
"recently renovated, the hotel is both hip and elegant, the location is perfect, and the service what you'd expect at the ritz. Had breakfast lunch and dinner in the bar area and the food and service were exceptional. Our room was enormous luxurious and comfortable which really made for an outstanding stay. would definitely return."
"Renovated rooms, excellent food, gym, spa and location. What else could I ask for?Used the house car to get to my meeting, had a great spa experience and the short rib burger at the lounge was to die for!will definetly go back!"
"Very impressed. We took 2 connecting rooms which looked newly refurbished with kids aged 8 and 11. Super quiet so 3 great nights sleep despite the jetlag from UK. Beds super comfortable and great pillow selection. Kids loved Netflix access on tv and really excellent queen twin beds. Breakfast selection very good but a bit annoying that kids pay the same $34 as adults (for an 8 year old - really?). Good bathroom - just that annoying US bath /shower combo. A walk in shower would have made the room perfect. Gym was very well equipped. No pool. Location fantastic for Chinatown and 20 min walk down to the piers (but a tough walk back up hill!). Loved the courtesy car option when available. Overall very highly recommended. 5 stars - rare from me having lived in the US, London and Asia. "
"I've stayed there a few times on business. It's very well located, and service is good, and clean, and restaurant was good, but for a Ritz it's only average at best. On my last stay, we had a very spacious suite, but very dark decor, we had no window in our suite bedroom, and bathroom was a bit depressing. I stayed at the St Regis also, and that was much nicer and sunnier."
Excellent..clean..professional hotel that has excellent service!Greeting at front desk excellentRook excellent conditionCarpet in hotel clean and looks new..The food in the club excellent esp if you compare to Washington..the workers who serve it also very friendly..The check out was smooth and made you feel they really want you back..you come back in the evening the staff welcomes you back home with a smile.
"Great Location and Amazing Hotel. Don't complain about the cost because you truly get a ""value"" for the price! It's that great of a place! Walking distance to all the great shopping and great food. Try this upscale place!"
Outstanding service and attention to detail... perfectly located... kid friendly.. One of our favorite one locations.. spacious rooms.. staff really go above and beyond...restaurant was very good...the valet service was very helpful
"Especially enjoyed the bedding, very comfortable. I slept like a baby during my stay. Also like the air conditioning, stable temperature. Feels like home during my stay. Staffs are very sweet and considerable. Perfect location for people who want to spend time in China Town."
2 nights and 1000 dollars later and I can say I stayed here and that about it. It's a room. The bed is nice but you are in San Fran you are going to go out not stay in a room. This is for the super rich. 
"This was my 3rd time staying at this lovely hotel. I was very happy with the recent renovation . They preserved the classic elements that I have always loved but refreshed them in a beautiful way. Our room was spacious , well decorated and a classic bathroom. I think the thing that makes this my favorite is the staff- from the minute you arrive you are treated like royalty- they are formal but very friendly- there's just something about the service level here that you just don't get most places- great location - one hill up (or down ! ) from China Town. Great location to shops too. I want to go back !"
"This hotel lives up to its excellent reputation. Luxury hotel from the moment you are greeted. Beautiful inside, the rooms are stunning, Italian decoration, soft grey/blues, whites, large marble floored bathrooms, top class accessories, Nespresso machine in room, Asprey bathroom items. The bar is great, and the location is excellent. Its a 10 min walk down the hill to Union Square. All the staff are wonderful."
"Last here when my wife was pregnant with our now 14 year old daughter. Still a beautiful hotel. We had a modern, spacious double queen room which was great. Dinner at Parallel 37 and drinks at lobby bar and both were excellent. Only problem we had was we had a big , hilly street outside our room and it was very noisy at morning and evening rush hour with cars and buses trying to climb hill. The windows were big single pane and definitely not conducive to noise reduction. Weird because we are from New York and are used to traffic noise at all hours. Definitely need new windows. Rooms facing front/back of hotel would be quieter I assume as streets are not as busy. Despite that I would probably return."
Our stay was absolutely perfect. Our room was fabulous. Everyone we encountered was so kind and happy from the Bell Hop to the maid staff and concierge. Every detail was attended. We could not have asked for a better experience. We stayed one week and it felt like home. We were actually excited to come back to hotel with such comfort at the end of long sight seeing days. I would recommend Ritz as the perfect place to stay. Great location and 5 star comfort!!!! 
"Upon arrival, before the check-in time of 4.00 pm, I was delighted to be told that my room was ready. My luggage was delivered by an efficient and informative bell hop who took his time to familiarize me with the local landmarks, pointing out where they were in relation to the hotel. The club lounge was spacious, well-appointed and comfortable. The staff in the lounge were more than fantastic, making sure that my every need was catered for. They made me feel like I was part of their family, spending time to inform and making sure that I was well looked after. The beverages and food presentations were meticulously laid out, delicious and more than enough for anyone. In summary, a luxurious hotel, with welcoming staff who deliver the highest standards of care and attention to detail in every setting. My thanks go to the staff who looked after me in the club lounge and allowing me to be part of their lives. Already booked and cannot wait until I return at Christmas to see them all again. Well done!"
"If you are trying to redeem Marriott points for an exceptional experience, the Ritz fell below my expectation. I am a Lifetime Marriott Elite and wanted to treat my wife to a glamorous three night pampering. Instead we were given no Club Level access and our room was almost as far from the elevator as physically possible, a very long walk. Small annoyance I know, but it was disappointing."
We visited the SFO Ritz for our Anniversary and my wife's birthday. The staff was exceptional - especially the club level staff. I'm a seasoned businesss traveler and I was extremely impressed with this hotel and highly recommend it.
We stayed for two days in this beautiful and elegant hotel where the rooms and bathrooms were well equipped to offer visitors a relaxed and wonderful stay. Breakfast although ecpensive was good but not value for money. The most annoying charge was 75 dollars per day for valet parking. When I complained regarding this they offered me some kind of discount if I had both parking and breakfast .For that kind of charge I would have expected them at least to clean the car. I later realised I could have parked for one third the price only few minutes walk away.I had to use Uber twice to go to dinner and they struggled to find the location of the hotel. They somehow ended up at the back of the hotel rather than the front entrance. I suggest the hotel looks at their Zip code.
What fabulous accommodations & personnel. Every staff truly wants you to have a lovely stay/time. Great location in the city. The lounge was fun as well as the JCB tasting room. We won't stay anywhere else. Thank you to Josh Gordon & all.
Invited for one big event we spend a nice week in this hotel where the halls for receptions are really amazing. Rooms are spacious and the VIP floor have some very nice facilities. The Spa is strangely small but the massage is absolutely fantastic. I take the massage regularly everywhere in the world but this one was exceptional – the REAL sportive massage.All at all the hotel is pretty but less glamour then some others Ritz Carltons like for ex. in Orlando (also because of the view). Not sure that I would choice this place for a romantic holidays but if you use to organise some big event in San Francisco this is definitely the ideal choice.
As you'd expect from a Ritz or other first class hotel. I'd come back in a heartbeat. No restaurant on Sunday night was a bit of a bummer however room service worked as we did not want to go out that night.
"I always expect top notch accommodations and service at a Ritz Carlton, and while some are better than others, the San Francisco Ritz Carlton is five stars in all respects. The room was spacious and well appointed with an extremely comfortable bed and luxurious linens. Every staff member we encountered (valet, front desk, concierge, housekeeping, hostess, waiters and waitresses, etc) were extremely helpful, solicitous, courteous and welcoming. "
My wife and I came to town to see our son in a baseball tournament and to take him to a Giants game. We decided to stay at the Ritz to see what the experience was like. They really are a top notch hotel and the experience was a great value. 
There is only one thing that keeps me from giving this hotel a 5 star rating. I arrived late at night after a flight from the east coast. It was after midnight my time. I plugged my iPad and phone chargers into the plug on the table lamp. I went to sleep immediately afterwards. When I woke up the next morning neither device was charged or charging. When I followed the lamp cord I found that it was plugged into an outlet below and being the desk. The outlet had a label saying that it would only work if the overhead lights were on. No excuse for this kind of thing from a Ritz Carlton
"We enjoyed every aspect of our trip. The staff was phenomenal. The only downside was the work that began in the hotel at 6am, knocking, moving, pounding.mentioned it to reception but no explanation given."
"Great location, excellent staff and well appointed spacious rooms. Good dining options on property and close to everything. The only item to be aware of is the $65 per day charge to park vehicles. Otherwise everything was first class."
"The service was excellent, and we felt right at home from the moment we walked in. The hotel is conveniently located with easy access to major attractions, such as Fisherman's Wharf via public transportation or walking. Our room was beautiful, but the club lounge was the best part of our stay. The food, ambiance, and service in the club lounge was perfect. We will definitely be back!"
Spent 4 nights for business trip. . Friendly staff and luxurious and comfortable room. Located in the Nob Hill area so highly recommend to take a cable car at Powell St and Pine St just one block from the hotel. 
Oddly enough this was the cheapest available option when I went since there was a conference in town and all the cheaper hotel rooms were booked up. Beautiful hotel. Extravagant really. Location is at the top of the hill so if you are walking be prepared for a steep hike.
great place except for the room---no chairs. bed was wonderful. the help was outstanding. nice friendly people. We enjoyed the breakfast and the bar. the waiters and bartenders were fun people. Bottom line--we loved it except for the room
"$600 for a basement room looking up at a courtyard. The people were fantastic and the property is beautiful. Just don't book this property if you expect to see ""San Francisco"" vs a court yard in Anchorage (Not that there anything wrong with Anchorage) when you pay $600 per night!!!!! Go to the Intercontinental! I guarantee nothing will come of this review - even though they can check my folio...."
"The U.S. is blessed with many fine hotels, but the Ritz-Carlton San Francisco is indisputably one of the best. An architecturally distinguished property in an interesting and convenient location, near enough to major shopping and downtown, but up Nob Hill enough to be away from the hustle bustle of SF. Excellent staff in every position at this hotel make you feel extremely welcome. A stay at this property -- particularly on the Club Floor -- cannot be beat."
"We visited San Francisco July 2017 for 9 days and had the pleasure of staying at the club level. As Ritz Reward members we have stayed at many different locations and this was one of the best. Great service, food, decor, etc. Strongly recommend, will be my hotel of choice when we visit again."
" Hotel staff could do nothing to help with the noisy rooms. We moved from my noisy room next to a street into a noisy room next to a housekeeping closet with someone in the room above dropping things and making noises at all times the day or night. They would not honor a request for an upgrade under the Amax find hotel and resort policy, though rooms were available. Room Service could not deliver yogurt and cereal and under one hour. Staff was completely unable to handle any of these issues "
"Went once and sat at the bar. Nice space in a pretty nondescript strip mall with a coffee place and a Mexican spot. Wife and I went back for our anniversary. Good service (Taylor?). We split a cheese plate and some prosciutto from their ham tasting menu. Well curated drink list with special beers, wines, and interesting cocktails. We split a bottle of Chardonnay. For entrees, Wife had the wood fire prawns with polenta and Brussels sprouts, and I had the pork chop with broccolini which was all good. Had gelato and sorbet for dessert. We had a nice evening out"
"I had the best time this visit to SFO Ritz Carlton. I usually prefer staying close to the Club Lounge & elevator but asked to be on the other side to possibly see the 4th fireworks display from my room. Little longer walk but although it was somewhat foggy, I could see fireworks at the wharf. Chinatown was quite lively as well. The staff of this hotel is amazing. I have never encountered anyone who wasn't genuinely friendly. The Club Lounge staff is outstanding. I spend a great deal of time in the Club Lounge and each staff member goes out of their way to make sure I have everything I need, they even know what table I prefer. I so enjoy chatting with them throughout my stay. Food is very good and the daily themes are interesting. Very nice wine tasting on Friday night. Housekeeping, at this hotel, has always been very good but this stay I found it even better (I am picky). I am already planning my next visit."
"Overall, I was pleased with the service from the staff. The staffs are very helpful in person as well as via texting. Few minor gaffes but definitely worth visiting again. A very comfortable stay with spacious rooms and good location."
"If arriving by car, plan your trip carefully so that you turn onto Stockton (upper) and not get stuck in the tunnel into Chinatown (Stockton, lower). The two roads do not connect, and you don’t want to drive in busy Chinatown! So, read your map. The turn is tight into the short driveway, and the staff are eager to get you unloaded ASAP. Luckily they have their own parking garage, being built into a hillside. We never had to wait long for our car, although the hotel was admittedly half-full at the time. In fact, the Lobby floor that you enter into is the 4th floor. A few floors above is the Club floor (8th); a few floors below is the enclosed courtyard with its big marquee tent for special occasions. We stayed on the Club floor, and our room afforded some airflow when the original steel-frame windows were muscled open the few inches that are allowed. Of course, the room’s air-conditioning worked just fine too, and the building is kept pleasantly cool; sometimes SF gets hot!The service here was excellent; our thanks especially to bellman Patrick and hostess Vicky in the Club Lounge, but there were no bad staff here. What makes this place so good, though, besides its staff and its beautiful white-marble facades, is its location. You’re right beside Chinatown, you’re a very brief walk from the upscale shopping in the Union Square district, and you’re a mid-to-long walk from the North End and the Waterfront. And there are always taxis right out front.We would return here next time we stay in downtown SF. Our only complaint is that the breakfasts in the Club lounge are not as interesting as the lunchtime or dinnertime snacks; and who eats porridge that soupy? Cook steel-cut oatmeal next time!As with any of our 5-star reviews, we declare that we have no personal or financial connection to this institution."
"We stayed at the RITZ for two nights in June, 2017 for leisure. Since we are spending lot of time outside during the day we elected not to use the club lounge. The rooms are impeccable and make you feel like you are in a very luxurious place, just as it should. The service was very nice right from the moment we drop off the car in front of the lobby. Good thing is they even charge your electric car when the car is parked with the valet. They offer towels and water bottles for early AM joggers and that was very useful for us as we left early to explore outside. The bar is nice to entertain or socialize without any overcrowding. we had people come and visit us, and that was so easy and casual unlike some places that make you feel too uptight unnecessarily. nice casual attire is good enough. no need for jackets etc. The morning breakfast was just perfect. and once we had breakfast in bed - served really well and in time. No food was wasted in break fast buffet, a testament to how the food was - fresh and tasty. We will go back there again. "
"You will love this property. The location is excellent, the service is impeccable, the staff will help you with all your needs and the food is fantastic!!!! The management here is wonderful! You will not be sorry. When I come to San Francisco I stay here because of this. If, per chance, you have an issue they will remedy it quickly and with the best service. Get your money's worth and stay at The Ritz Carlton when you visit San Francisco. You won't be sorry. "
"Stayed in an adding room suite for 3 nights.Great Hotel, with friendly staff and great amenities.Comfortable rooms with all the little touches.We travelled with a 2 year old, so the kids room was a great option away from the roomBe prepared to stroll the hills a little"
"We stayed for five nights our first time in San Fran. Checked in quickly and efficiently. I normally do not have our room serviced during our stay, but since we were here for five nights I would take the privacy sign off whenever we would leave. The bell men and staff greeting you as you come in are fabulous, and the house keeping staff is incredible. I cannot say enough great things about the kind, caring nature of them and how everything seems just above and beyond. They pay attention to little things that are very much appreciated. We stayed on the 4th floor from 7/3-7/9- thank you thank you to everyone that made our stay special but especially the house keeping. Our room was restocked, refreshed, and immaculate every time we returned. We never wanted or needed for anything. I would highley recommend this hotel- we enjoyed our stay. "
"Like all great hotels the staff at the Ritz is as good as it gets. From the new Manager to the Bartenders in the Lobby lounge, to the Concierge, everyone went out of their way to make us feel like family. We will be back because of the outstanding level of service."
"exceptional in all facets. location, rooms, lounge, fitness center, front desk, housekeeping, in house dinning, room service, cleanliness , concierge, bell house staff, doormen, servers, easy access to explore town."
"This hotel went through a renovation a couple years ago, that took and exquisite, gorgeous hotel, and turned it into a less interesting spot. The service is good. But they decor went from a classic look, to a silly modern look that clashes with the architecture. The interior designer that sold them this horrible redesign should be fired, and the place studied as a perfect example of what NOT to do when redecorating. Fortunately, the staff is still good, the amenities top line, and the bar does well with drinks. A good thing, because the only thing that makes the new decor tolerable is lots of alcohol."
"Very nice hotel, friendly service, we had a superior King room which is roomy enough for 2 with a nice size bathroom (double sinks). We ate breakfast every morning at Parallel 37...had their buffet which had a good variety. Hotel is centrally located. Overall happy with our stay."
"As always, Ritz staff is top notch. Pleasant experience and best accommodations. Love that you can stream Netflix and other media services to your room. Ideal if you have kids also. Only complain is pillows are way too soft. Which is ongoing theme with all Marriott properties. "
"Was visiting San Francisco and enjoying dinner - stayed at the Ritz. The room was nice. Wife took advantage of the spa and I the gym. The hotel is pretty centrally located for San Francisco. Now with Uber, everything is easy to access."
Our favor hotel to stay when we travel. We always stay in The Ritz-Carlton. The staffs are great and very friendly and helpful. We are on gluten free diet and the staffs in the lounge went out of their way to meet our needs. The room is very clean.
"Always love the ritz. Club level is convenient and really helps with the planning of our day. Nicholas and Gabrielle were a big help. Every staff member is exceptional. The rooms are clean and well decorated Location? Not a fan, but honestly, San Francisco is not the place for me or my family. However, if it were, I would suggest staying closer to the wharf. Again, the Ritz is a great hotel from start to finish. "
"Have stayed at this hotel many times - however hotel did not acknowledge that fact and did not provide upgrade as I am Gold member. Hotel did not honor other preferences as well. Overall hotel is average. I was on a free night certificate from the Ritz credit card promotion, will likely cancel my card when it expires in a few months, simply not worth it. Ritz Carltons are not that special any more."
"Overall the stay was positive the only slight was service from certain areas of the property seemed slack or disingenuous...maybe the Hotel should lean away from welcoming young families, it seemed quite business orientated..."
"This hotel, its staff and the support teams around the hotel, were amazingly attentive, provided personal service and exceeded all of our expectations. The food in the Lounge and room service were excellent and the service was impeccable with the staff addressing us by name at all times. The second time we entered the Lounge, the staff (Neziel) greeted us by name and remembered our orders from the previous day- seriously impressing our children."
"We usually stay at either the St. Regis or the Four Seasons, but I wanted to get away a bit from the hubbub and so forth near Market Street so I booked the Ritz and I thought it was superior in several ways - the rooms were amazing, as several reviewers commented, they are huge and really comfortable and quiet. Second, the location is great since very few homeless venture up the hill. (Sorry, but San Francisco really has a major homeless problem and it's sad to see it). I didn't find it too much trouble to walk up and down the hill, and the hotel has a car that was available when we needed it, and uber was easy from here also. The staff was just great, especially at reception, the front door, and the concierge. I also enjoyed an amazing breakfast and lunch here. All in all, my new favorite hotel in San Francisco. "
"Somewhat old building, not easy nor logical in its lay out of rooms and acres/exit doors, with suite appointments to counter the previous. Large, well appointed. Outstanding service is what made our stay memorable. Good culinary offerings. Very nice bar with a good selection of wines and spirits. We will return."
"We stayed for one night at the beautiful Ritz Carlton, and would have loved to have stayed for longer. All of the staff we encountered were exceptionally helpful, pleasant and professional, and the hotel itself is absolutely stunning - both public areas and the room we had were modern, fresh and spotlessly clean. The only slight drawback is that the hotel is situated on top of a steep hill, but this is San Francisco so I guess you have to expect that!"
"When I was checking in clad in a cashmere blazer the staff was more than wonderful. When I got back to hotel at 5am in conservative but clearly pride attire, not a soul to be found anywhere in hotel lobby--no doorman, valet, security, or checkin staff anywhere. I didn't have a room key. After roaming the lobby for several minutes, I finally started screaming. The clerk finally came out. Couldn't have been less than apologetic. Friend and I were dressed in conservative but clearly pride attire and couldn't get any service in the restaurant. The hotel also lost my bags they held at check out. Found them 30 min later. "
"Splurged on a weekend at the Ritz just for fun. With the help of the Amex FHR program, our one bedroom suite was upgraded to the Club Floor.Hits:* the redecorated rooms are a positive change. More modern, fresh and less formal than the previous design. No view but very luxurious nonetheless.* great location. We shopped in Union Square and on Saturday morning walked on Stockton St. To Broadway while enjoying the buzz of early morning Chinatown. Great fun seeing the merchants offering fruit, veg, ducks, seafood, dim sum et al to their customers.* the main lounge and bar area were much more lively than on our last visit. Excellent drinks, service and snacks. Also featured a singer and her guitar playing band member on Friday evening. Great fun.* doorman was friendly and helpful upon checkin and checkout. He also arranged for us a ride in the hotel's BMW for our short drive to dinner at Leo's Oyster Bar. We walked home up Sacramento St. Slight misses:* everyone seems to love the Club Floor. We were a little disappointed in it for two reasons: the new decor makes it more corporate and less clubby than the prior design. It felt more like an airport business class lounge than a Ritz Carlton. Also, we were recently spoiled by the Club Floor at an international Ritz where the staff poured drinks in the evening and the chef prepared customized egg dishes in the morning. Strictly a self help buffet environment in SF.* Paralell 37, the RC restaurant, has no real buzz. It replaced its highly formal predecessor but has not established itself as a destination restaurant. The restaurant and its bar were sparsely populated throughout our stay.All in all, a very fun weekend at the Ritz."
"Pros: Spacious roomsAccommodating staff with out of the ordinary requests.Great breakfast buffet and amazing staff!Location: Just around the corner from the busy part of San Francisco. Walking distance to all the attractions.What can you say, it's a Ritz! Cons: None!"
We had a lovely time at this property while enjoying the city. Hotel was in a great location & the staff was excellent. Club level was outstanding & will diffently be back to visit & explore more of the beautiful city. 
"For such an amazing city, it's surprisingly tough to find a stand out, consistently great hotel in San Francisco. But perhaps the Ritz is starting to be that place for us.We needed a couple nights on both side of a longer stay in California and decided to give the Ritz a try. We've had great success with the club floor at other RCs so we tried it out here as well and were very glad we did.The club itself has all the typical elements you'd expect in an RC club. All the food available was delicious, fresh and plentiful throughout the day. I really love being able to grab sparkling water throughout the day. The staff as well were friendly and great about getting us anything we needed.For just a night on each side we stayed in a normal club room. For a normal room though, it felt spacious and had everything we needed. The room was clean and everything was in good working order. My only complaint is actually common in many bathrooms across the world. Why is the sink faucet so close to the bowl? In our second room it almost seemed like you were touching the bowl anytime you washed your hands. Other than this minor flaw, everything in the bathroom was excellent. I really appreciate that RCs have lots of extra amenities in the room so you don't have to call down for basics in case you forget something.The room was very dark and quiet at night so we got a great night's rest both evenings. We also made it down to the gym both visits and everything down there was clean and well maintained. Minus the usual limitations of a hotel gym (low dumbbell weights and limited equipment) we were able to get a good workout in.Overall service was top notch and next time we're back in the area, unless something changes drastically in the SF hotel market, I'll be back at the RC staying on the club floor."
"Some times in travel bad things happen. Not every stay is perfect. We had a couple human error issues. Things happen, you find out what a hotel is worth when staff and management respond. I believe this property does everything they can to insure their guest enjoy the time spent there. Great location and amenities."
Great old world style hotel with a nice touch of modern. Great location for walking to Union Square and local restaurants. Very kid friendly which is always a concern for us at upscale hotels. Staff was very attentive and welcoming. We truly enjoyed the experience and look to return soon. 
"Well managed & consistently excellent service & cuisine!! The Concierge service was simply excellent and the Doorman was not only marvelous to deal with. When an UBER driver unexpectedly tried to ""take us for a ride"" Miguel came to our rescue and prevented us from being taken advantage of-or worse! The facility was perfectly groomed and exceptionally maintained. A true delight!!"
"This Ritz Hotel in S. F. is so warm, friendly and service is welcoming that I feel like they are a ""home away from home!"" I always stay on their CLUB FLOOR because they provide extra concierge support and food and drink selections throughout the day. well worth extra expense!"
"We stayed in the suite, which was very lovely- beds were incredibly comfortable and had a great view. The showers are environmentally friendly so the water pressure is low. A small but annoying nuisance was the sink, the faucet was too short for the sink so your hand is constantly hitting the back. The club level is great, you can quickly get snacks, coffee, drinks, water etc... everyone on this level were incredibly kind and helpful. My issue: I called to get my shirt and pants pressed at 3:00PM to see if I get it back by 5:00PM the next day (25hrs notice). The lady I spoke to was not comforting, stating ""maybe we can get it by 5:00 but probably 6:00-7:00pm instead though"". Unfortunately I needed to at 5:00pm, we went back and forth and she stated well you have an iron and board so you can get it done before then. I conceited a bit irritated, this was a big mistake since the next day the Union Square area lost power, no fault of their own. However they were not helpful in anyway for a solution, wouldn't even help with suggestions on where to go to get a press. Luckily with no help from the Ritz, we found a local clean and press that were more than willing to help."
A romantic weekend at the Ritz in San Francisco had high expectations but came up short. My wife and my dog stayed this past weekend at the Ritz. The location is excellent with access to most major landmarks within walking distance. The views from the top of the hill are amazing and the hotel is very clean and a romantice setting. The reason we had issues is that promises made where not kept. We paid an extra $125.00 for our small 8lbs dog and did not receive any of the benefits promised. We are Platinum memebers and did not receive the benefits our our membership such as a room upgrade. The hotel is amazing and we will give it another try as we do frequent San Francisco.
"We stayed for 3 nights at The Ritz Carlton in San Franciso. It is close to Union Square (and lots of shopping) and Chinatown. The staff was on the ball and courteous. We had requested 2 connecting rooms which they granted upon arrival. The rooms themselves were spacious, clean and lovely. They had city views. The bathrooms only had a tub/shower combo which I thought was strange considering most Ritz Carlton properties have separate showers and tubs. The room service was delightful and we ordered the huevos rancheros every morning for breakfast. The concierge met every request with a smile and great information.We had a lovely stay and will return some day soon."
"We had the pleasure of staying at the Ritz SF for 3 nights during a portion of our honeymoon. Upon arrival it is very clear that this is a first-class hotel with fantastic service. Since you don't really need your car in San Francisco, it was a breeze to valet the car and not have to worry about it for a few days. The valet and check-in process was seamless. We received a warm welcome and during our entire stay we felt comfortable and carefree. Parallel 37 and the lobby bar were both wonderful and would recommend for brunch and cocktails. We received chocolate covered strawberries as a welcome gift.As for the room - HUGE. This is probably the largest hotel room in terms of square feet that you are going to find in San Francisco. The bathroom was perfect - double sinks and a large marble shower. Fully stocked for everything you would need. The beds were very comfortable and there was zero noise at night, since we were on the top floor. The rooms and spacious and comfortable, with in-room coffee maker and plenty of closet space. We slept great and felt refreshed after our departure.If you are asking me if this hotel is worth the cost in San Francisco - I will tell you it definitely is. We also stayed at the Westin in Union Square during our last night in the city and you can't even compare the two. We are loyal Starwood/Marriott members and love the Westin brand. However, for the extra money you simply cannot beat the Ritz for value. Our room at the Westin was a shoebox at $260 a night, and the amenities were dreadful compared to the Ritz. That's just my comparison, but hopefully that puts things in perspective. Also, don't be afraid of the $65 for valet parking...it was $75 at the Westin. The comfort and ideal location in Nob Hill is worth it, and we will be staying at the Ritz SF again in the future for sure. Cannot wait to return!"
We stayed in one of the suites and truly loved this place. The rooms are large and newly refreshed. It was great to come home to after a long day of tourist fun around the city. We can say enough about it. The club floor is worth it too.
"Pros:-Huge(!) rooms have enough space to pack 2 extra queen beds-Excellent service as usual across the board-Food quality is good though they can expand their late night menu selection with slightly more complicated dishesCon:-Quiet location on top of hill, awkward for walkers/bikers-For the Ritz Carlton brand in general, poor recognition of membership status (e.g. compared to top tier SPG, no free breakfast, no welcome drink, no complimentary upgrades)-Not really a minus, but lobby area feels more like a luxurious clubhouse than a grand hotel."
"everything was great - room, lobby, service, location. I appreciated the platinum recognition- we were upgraded to a suite Lounge provided very good food with excellent breakfast and lounge ( but OK evening appetizers - not very impressive) Everyone is genuinely happy to help and to serve beds were super comfortable they have a car available for the guests."
I usually stay at the st Regis as an Spg member but since the Marriott merger decided to try out their luxury offering in SF. The ritz is located in a great location and the staff is wonderful. I received a text in advance from the concierge asking what I would like upon arrival. I said a bucket of ice in my room and water. When I finally arrived there was no bucket of ice but it arrived at turn down service . The bed was very comfortable and the room a good size. The only thing that isn't up to par for a luxury property is the bathroom. It doesn't have a separate shower which I was surprised at since most hotels in this range have a separate tub and shower. Overall a great experience .
"The overall experience at TRC was incredible. The staff, the hotel, service, absolutely everything was spectacular. We would stay again given the opportunity. For such a high-end hotel we were made to feel totally welcomed!"
Truly beautiful and amazing hotel.Incredible attention to detail and customer service clearly with some of the most highly trained staff and customer focused staff that I have ever seen at a hotel.Beautiful rooms and a great experience!
We have stayed at this Ritz several times over the years. I will say that the service is always impeccable. We typically stay on the Club floor so that we can have leisurely meals throughout the day. Since our last visit the décor had been completely modernized. It seemed too bright and very sterile. The seats were very narrow to the point that I always felt like I was going to slide off onto the floor (and I am not a large person)! The food selections had also been changed and were not up to the standard that I am used to.Our room was spacious with a great view of the city. Our only complaint is that we could not seem to get the room cool enough at night. I always woke up in the morning congested and hot.I'm hoping that the San Francisco Ritz is just going through some growing pains. We will be back but hope that this hotel returns to the standards it used to have.
"As always, the Ritz provides outstanding service and amenities we were greeted upon arrival and given warm hand towels to refresh. We received our request for a high floor with a view. The accommendations were quite nice. "
It's been some times I stayed at Ritz Carlton. I almost forgot how awesome every night every experience at any of their places are. Check in early late check out allowed. This is the kinda service you only receive in Asia at the best hotels. 
Excellent facility and positive experience.Highly recommendable. Staff very welcoming. Great breakfast and bar lounge.Location near shopping centers and great restaurants. You can walk to these locations.
"The Ritz Carlton Suite is a magical home away from home. The living room was perfect for entertaining friends, there was ample space in the bedroom for yoga exercises, and the western and northern views showed off San Francisco in all of its splendor. I stayed here while my kitchen was being remodeled, and once I arrived I felt like I was in a second home."
Nice property but don't plan on sleeping. The rooms facing any street are very loud. Only has 8 floors and the main level is level four so you never get high enough to get away from he noise. We had a club level room. They should put a disclaimer especially when you are paying $1000 per night 
"I typically prefer Starwood hotels, but since the merger I have moved into some of the Marriotts and Ritz. Typical Ritz - Great people, good food and a solid experience. The hotel is a little bit older, which you can tell in the wood work.Otherwise, I recommend this place!"
We stayed here for 9 days.The rooms were big so perfect for traveling families. 2 queen beds and a sofa that works as a bed for small children . Walking distance to union square. Excellent service . Clean rooms. Good food for room service ( their burger and chicken fingers with BBQ sauce is so yummy ! ) good location. 
We like the Ritz Carlton hotels when on holiday and prefer the club room amenities. The San Francisco Ritz Carlton is up there with their best. Everything you expect from a Ritz Carlton is there. Club room amenities are great for breakfast and snacks throughout the day. Staff are extremely friendly and the concierge extremely helpful with advice on shopping and local amenities. There is cable car stop not far from the front entry and China Town is just a street away.Will be back and would definitely recommend as a base for a holiday in San Francisco.
"I read numerous reviews on hotels in the SF area before selecting the Ritz Carlton for a 4 day stay with my wife and daughter. My other choice was The Four Seasons, but I liked the location of The Ritz, the club level services and some of their rooms had 1.5 baths. I made the right choice. If you are looking for customized attention and engaged customer service, pick this hotel. The club service is exceptional, the food is very good and the Hotel offers a car service for close pickups/drop-offs around town, which was very convenient."
Pick a Club Lounge Suite - the team is amazing - they all seem to be in charge as everyone is so invested in making every request appear easy and a pleasure to complete. It may sound dumb - but the tuna salad at lunch is the best - and if the Tuna salad is the tip of the iceberg - everything after that is even better!!
"Another great evidence why Ritz Carlton is at the top of the league as far as hotels are concerned. Luxury rooms which go beyond customers expectations, and high standards facilities. Very polite and helpful staff."
"Celebrated my daughter's birthday with a mother daughter get away! Shopping, dinner and play. Rooms were spacious and very well appointed. Bedding was beautiful and very comfortable.Having the opportunity to enjoy the Club Level made our stay extra special! Food and service were outstanding.I highly recommend the Ritz Carlton San Francisco as a must do experience!!! You will not be disappointed!!!"
"Great hotel & location. Great guest services. Stayed in the Club Level 9th floor. Disappointed our guest, who had the other room I provided had to wait 1 1/2 hours to get their room. This was a disappointment."
"Lovely stay at a terrific property. Convenient place to walk from and the staff is friendly and helpful. We had a great getaway weekend and would do it again. The valet called our name in to the front deck, I thought that was a nice touch."
"The rooms were beautiful, and the food at the club level buffet was awesome. Our only complaint was that the spa area was not very zen, and generally didn't wow us. The day we went down to sign up for a service, there was some sort of conference event in a nearby room, and you could hear all the hustle and bustle, so there wasn't a peaceful area to relax in. We also went back for our service the next day, right at the time of the appointment, and there was no one at the desk. We waited for 10 minutes and no one came, so had to go up to the front desk and ask what was going on. However, the spa staff was very friendly and helpful when they did appear."
"The San Fran Ritz Carlton is a great hotel, with first class valet, lounge and bell staff. The beds are very comfortable and the location is very close to China a town. If you are looking for a first class stay and don't mind spending the money, this is a good location. "
 THE RITZ is top notch . Could not ask for a better place . Very close to all i needed . My husband was ill an in the hospital in sfo for surgery it was nice to know they provided a car to take me to and from hospital . i did not need to worry about parking or driving in the city . the reception as well as the bell boys and valet were great made sure all my needs were met breakfast was wonderful .. safe all was wonderful . i recommend the ritz than any other place well worth it ... 
"I was so thrilled with my stay here last week! The rooms were beautiful (loved the bathroom with two sinks!), very clean and the staff couldn't haven't been more helpful. Awesome location and delicious food and cocktails at the bar! I only stayed for one night but the next time I go back to San Fran I will definitely be staying here!"
"We have stayed at this property several times thru the years. The last time we were here was 5 years ago and they have updated the rooms since then. Ironically, this is one of my issues with this hotel. The update doesn't seem as elegant as it should be. In fact, I swear some of the decorations are the same as the Marriott County Hall in London. The impression it left me with is that it looks more like a J W then a Ritz. The rooms are very large for a hotel in the city. However, the bathroom has a combined tub/shower, and that feels a bit of a cheat in a hotel of this category. However - the staff in this hotel is exceptional. They go out of their way to be helpful and polite. I wish all hotels had a staff of this caliber! Also, the club floor is really well done. Great food, drinks, and again, a lovely staff. All in all, this is a very pleasant place to stay and the location is excellent."
"Very nice hotel, very clean in a great location you can walk to shops. Also can walk to the A T and T park. Just don't eat breakfast unless you have a food voucher that was a rip off. Because I book it with trip adviser we did not get a food voucher and it was over 100.00 for breakfast and it was not that good. The city at the hotel location is great and very awesome!"
"Standard come up short on this RITZ CARTON hotel in San Francisco. For the price you pay, I would stay elsewhere for the same if not better quality of amenities. The rooms size is fair for San Francisco. However, I did see spiders in the bathroom. And the windows are not child friendly as well. If you have a toddler, you must watch them consistently, the windows opens, and NO mesh to on the windows either. (BE CAREFUL) Views are ok. BUT the windows does NEED a cleaning. Valet is great but does take a while. Concern yourself warned"
"Beautiful property, but located in a hilly area, so not easy to just take a quick walk. The Cable Car can take you there, should you decide to visit Embarcadero, which is a fun way to get to this hotel."
"Booked through AMEX FHR. Called day before that we would like early check-in. Called on way down from Napa that we were coming. Arrived and went to check-in and room not ready. No big deal, said room was vacated and they would notify housekeeping to put a rush on it. We went down to Chinatown, had some great dim sum and shopped and looked around...3 hours later, now 3:30pm, got a text the room was ready. However we must have gotten upgraded because the room was this HUGE corner suite on the SW corner w views of TransAmeica building and Golden Gate bridge, looking right down into Chinatown with the sound of the streetcar's bell. Quintessential SF. (Don't know how we could hear the charming street cars but no other road noise but this was the case) The furnishings in the living room were sleek and modern, not terribly comfortable, but I supposed overstuffed and stodgy doesn't sell too well in this market. The bed was super comfortable!Room service was prompt discreet and terrific. Great huevos rancheros! The lobby bar was a great place for craft cocktails and solidly prepared standards both before and after dinner out on the town. Thanks for the great stay-will definitely stay here again."
"Our extended family was at the SF Ritz for a family wedding. Some of us were lucky to be on the Club Floor. The quality of the experience cannot be overstated, and the Concierge Gabrielle De Gray was amazing in supporting the family and all of the usual drama that occurs around a wedding. And all of this was on a busy holiday weekend. P.S. The food on the Club Floor was also fantastic."
"The Ritz Carlton San Francisco is very well situated right next to China town, near cable car and a short walk from the Ferry Plaza Farmer's Market (I recommend you visit the market on a Saturday.) Our room was generous in size and was very comfortable. As expected, easy to valet park the car. No pool, but a sufficient work out area. For the most part the staff was professional, helpful and friendly: the exception being house keeping and one of the hotel concierges. Housekeeping came and stripped the beds and took the towels out of my room very early the one day that we had late checkout and on the other days even though I called down and asked for the room to be done, they came very late to clean. There is the chance that it wasn't the room staff, but rather the person on the other end of the phone who was in competent: perhaps house keeping is under staffed (this should be reevaluated). One person who excelled was the hostess for the high tea. We didn't have a reservation and they were fully booked. Because of a no show, she was able to fit us in. The waitress was exceptional as well. They were both kind, patient and very helpful. While the Ritz Carlton San Francisco may fall under the category of a solid business hotel in a great location, it is lacking some of the ""bells and whistles"" that one is to expect from the RC brand. There is definitely room to grow."
"Pre-Napa visit to San Francisco. We stayed at this Ritz Carlton 2 years ago, but it had not yet been updated. This trip was perfect - the high level of personalized service and sumptuous accommodations were worth every penny!"
"Well situationed with blocks away from the landmark Union Square but is quiet and undisturbed. The classical style and history of the building provides good comfort with prestige and excellency. The hotel people are friendly, and are good to recogize the client and the needs whenever they pass by, especially those in the Parallel 37 restaurant. People in concierge arequite knowledgeable, and provide very good suggetion and choice of sight seeing and fine dining in the city, definatley adding the overall satisfaction and good memory for the stay."
"My husband and I were celebrating our last night on our honeymoon in San Francisco. We had a rental car, and wanted to drop off our luggage at the Ritz before returning the car. We were getting close to the time we needed to return our car, and the bell service took our bags so quickly and efficiently. They also offered to return our car for us! Since we were on a tight deadline, we declined. When we walked back from the car rental place, we were exhausted from walking up the San Francisco hilly streets. During check-in, the Ritz staff could tell we were out of breath and grabbed us a couple of water bottles. We told them we were in town for our honeymoon, and the staff was kind enough to offer a room upgrade at no extra charge. They also surprised us with a bottle of champagne in our room to celebrate our honeymoon. We were greeted every time we came in out went out of the hotel, and the hotel concierge was so helpful when we wanted to send wine bottles home. Overall, it was an amazing stay. The Ritz has staff that go above and beyond for their customers. We will definitely be back. Thank you! -Mr. & Mrs. Strausbaugh"
"The service at this hotel is amazing. The door men are very kind and polite. The front desk staff was very helpful and informative at check in. The hotel texted me as soon as my flight landed to make sure I was arriving and if I needed anything just to reach out. You could text the number for restaurant recommendations, assistance making reservations, anything you needed they answered efficiently.(Jamison G to be exact) But the Guest Relations team is 5 star. Mika, Yolly and Kristine made sure that my stay at the Ritz was perfect! They made my birthday trip to San Francisco memorable. I loved the city and hotel. I will be back without a doubt"
"What a terribly disappointing stay. With the myriad of luxury choices one would think that the RC San Fran would be at the top of their game. They're not. Not even close. Having stayed at the Four Seasons San Fran and the Fairmont San Fran, we had high expectations. I honestly wished that we would have checked out after our first night. We also arrived by Uber from SFO; apparently that made us ineligible to have doors held for us or even to be greeted. At the front desk, Roe failed to greet me as a Platinum Member or offer me any Platinum Amenities, nor did he mention that there was a car service that was available at the hotel (I found that as I was reading reviews after the stay to see where we went wrong). The Ritz Kids program is paltry and pathetic. No check in desk, no goodies for the kiddos. This was so disappointing after our AMAZING experience in DC two weeks prior where children are a priority (brilliant marketing). When I asked about a paid club level upgrade I was told that they were sold out (despite being available online). We had booked a one bedroom suite... parents be warned: the suites do have non locking french doors closing off the living space HOWEVER there are large glass windows on each door with gauzy, sheer curtains on each making privacy or even evening tv watching an impossibility. The bathroom in the suite is past the living area, not en suite also making for a challenging environment. Before our stay we had confirmed two rollaway beds, twice via email. We also confirmed via text that day. When we arrived in the room, there was only one bed. So frustrating!!! Of note, the mattresses on the rollaway beds were horribly old and uncomfortable; very thin and uneven. Had my children been any larger, they would have had terrible back pain. What is the point of confirmation via text AND email if you aren't going to follow through? The remainder of our stay was very similar. Although housekeeping did an excellent job, requests via the app were ignored, yet shown as ""completed."" We arrived back to our room one evening and one of the sinks had had a DISGUSTING back up. Apparently the room next door was blocked and they cleared it, but didn't think to check our room to see if the SHARED drain line had been affected. As we didn't receive turn down service, no one found the mess until we returned to our room at 9 pm. Such an awful inconvenience as we wanted to put the children down after a long day of sightseeing. We didn't ever see or experience true Ritz service. The smiles and attentiveness of the Ladies and Gentlemen just didn't exist here. After two days we asked about the kids amenity kits and received them. Our children completed the scavenger hunt (it was challenging but fun) and then they received Ritz Kids t-shirts as their ""prize."" The last thing kids want (or need) is a tshirt that promotes your property. I did at one point share my disappointment with the front desk. The agent offered to send a bottle of Veuve to the room as an apology. 2 hours later a bottle of Gloria Ferrar appeared. When I sent it back (as it was not as promised), they delivered a half bottle of Veuve. So very, very tacky after a deceitful bait and switch. I did see staff falling all over themselves for a family decked out in Louboutins and YSL... perhaps you need to show off your one percenting in order to receive decent service at this hotel. It's really a shame, we're normally Ritz/Marriott loyal but we'll go back to the Four Seasons the next time that we're in San Fran and be treated not only with respect, but in a manner that makes us want to return. **I emailed the front desk manager and he did place half a nights points (we stayed for three nights in a one bedroom suites) in our Marriott account for our ""inconveniences."""
"What went wrong with this one? The entrance to the hotel looks liek you enter the back door of a hotel instead od a 5* star one.Rooms are nice nut to get there you need to go through an impersonal meeting room area (on the 3rd floor at least) and the you need to go down a little stair (10 steps), no problem unless you carry your own luggage because nobody seemed to be bothered to help me with that (I did arrive in an Uber so maybe that means I'm not important?).And than they forget the durn down service, well actually they noticed my do not disturbe sign which inmmost hotels will lead to a card being piushed under the door so tou knwo they have been and can ask for it once yuo leave your room, but apparently not in the RC. Not impressed at all and next time in SF I will go for something else for sure and as a first time user of RC this is clearly not a reason to try any other one, so next time back to my Park Hyatt or anything similar."
"Great location, huge rooms and smelled delicious! Highly recommend the property for beautiful building, attentive staff and perfect experience. Bed was so comfy and staff was very experienced being extra helpful! "
"Wonderful hotel. Excellent service; great location near union square. Club level is terrific. Only downside is street noise. If this bothers you, request a courtyard view. Rooms a bit smaller but quiet."
"The Ritz has always been a favorite destination for special occasions for my girlfriends and me (usually for our ladies getaway birthday trips). This past weekend I took my son for his 10th birthday (to celebrate his entry into double digits!) Wow, the Ritz went above and beyond any expectations I had! First, the Club Level Concierge gave him a personalized kids robe as a 1st time welcome and birthday gift. Then a nice tray of sweet treats was delivered... and in the evening, a treat of different flavored gourmet popcorn and personalized note for him and his friend. His friend was so surprised they included him by name on the card.... it was a great touch and both boys had a blast! Ritz definitely upped the bar, can't wait for the next ladies trip!"
We spent three nights at this hotel and had a perfectly wonderful experience start to finish. The staff were excellent and we were treated like royalty. The room was elegantly furnished and extremely comfortable. We will definitely be back
"Beautiful property, elegant & contemporary at the same time. The bed was heaven. Loved the decor of the room; simple and elegant. The staff was superb.Meeting rooms were beautiful, food was wonderful. Chocolates divine. All in all a wonderful experience."
"Having spent many weekends in San Francisco: we have probably tried most of the top hotels. The only reason we had skipped the Ritz was that it seemed a bit too traditional for us. We had heard about the fairly recent renovation and decided to give it a try. Plus being a part of Am Ex Fine Hotels and Resorts programs was a big perk. ( and came with great perks). Needless to say, the hotel was a huge part of why we had an amazing trip this time. We were upgraded to a deluxe room..which had plenty of space and the perfect mix of old and new. A step in tub for sure but still a excellent shower, bath amenities from Aspry in London, a wonderful bed, coffee service and quiet. Even a very San Fran view. which we enjoyed. We took advantage of the bar for our late arrival meal and drinks each night. Outstanding. We only did breakfast and brunch at the restaurant which were some of the best meals on a trip filled with Michelin starred restaurants. The location aside from one large hill is perfection. (After a workout in the impressive gym, we decided walking Nob Hill was the best exercise anyway ). The building is an architectural gem and you are close to so many things or an easy Uber ride away. ( taxis are all always waiting out front) Finally but most importantly was the service. Which unlike this review comes first. It was beyond five star. Everyone seemed to know your name after the first day and said hello or welcomed you back as if you were family. A few shout outs including Kara at the front desk. A few times I just stopped by to say hi. Nicole and Neziel in the bar were super friendly and although we had planned most everything in advance I wouldn't hesitate to let the concierge team work their magic on our next trip. And there will be a next trip. The Ritz Carlton is now the only hotel in San Francisco for us. "
"We often stay at Ritz properties because we enjoy the consistency of the experience. The San Francisco location was no exception. From the cheerful greeting at reception, to our beautiful Club-level suite, to the many small touches that made our anniversary trip special (champagne in the room, rose petals on the bed, etc.) - the ladies and gentlemen of the Ritz rose to the occasion once again. We will certainly return."
"One of the prettiest Ritz Carlton Hotels I've seen! The club lounge was fantastic, as well as the service. My daughter and I had a wonderful time in San Francisco. I've stayed in many hotels in SF, and this experience was one of my best! I would definitely stay here again. "
"We went as a group and some of us stayed at Club level. The staff were attentive and professional with great hospitality. I received a comp massage - that was fabulous experience. Normally, the hotels in the city have smaller rooms but our group found rooms to be very big - spacious ! Nice view of SF from the hotel. Like most good things, this hotel is on the hill WALKING in high heels not advisable - one friend expressed this painful experience."
"A truly remarkable property. Location was perfect for getting anywhere in the city. Staff was fabulous, as you would expect for a Rtiz. You certainly pay for the Ritz experience, but it was well worth it."
"Our ""go to"" hotel brand--Ritz Carlton--did not let us down. Another pleasant stay at the 5 star property this time in San Francisco. We bunked in on the Club Level and the round the clock amenities were superb. You got to check out the coffee machine that can dispense excellent lattis and cappuccinos. Coming home to our regular coffee machine/Nespresso machine was a bit of a downer.The room while not large was more than comfortable for the two of us. The room decorations were top draw. Our room, facing north, had a wonderful view of the City. The staff as is typical of Ritz Carlton hotels were friendly and helpful when needed. Having a Club Level concierge was very convenient. The staff went out of their way to arrange a wine tasting for us as our daughter is getting married at the Ritz Carlton in Washington DC (at the Georgetown property) and as we were together in San Francisco we all got to taste and select the wines to be served at the wedding. Thanks to Mr. Major for having made all of the necessary arrangements on such short notice. But that's what you expect when staying at a Ritz Carlton.Considering all the times we have stayed at a Ritz Carlton hotel and all of the events we have hosted (two daughters and two Ritz weddings) I feel that we are our own hotel profit center. But the level of service we have always enjoyed make the value proposition very worthwhile."
"Eric at the Front Office was amazing. I could type on and on about what he did for us, but all and all He is great. We will stay every time we are in SF because of his interactions with us. Eric seemed new but did not let that stop him from reaching out to us everytime we walked by."
"Its a Ritz so what else is there to say. Service is on point, rooms are well appointed and comfortable, bar and restaurant are all excellent. Great gym and convenient location close to the Ferry Building and Union Square."
Wonderful stay ! Awesome location in the heart of the city. Top notch service. Highly recommend this hotel. Rooms were spacious and spotless. The doormen are awesome ! They even chauffeured us around for a couple of short trips saving us the hassle of calling a cab 
Enjoyed a stay here with my family. Decent location. Rooms were nice. Felt the staff to be a bit inattentive. This was most true in the property's restaurant where service seemed a bit amateur. The valets were great.
"We spent two nights at the Ritz-Carlton in San Francisco, and it was a great experience. The hotel is conveniently located just down from Nob Hill. We stayed in the Club level, which provides a fantastic breakfast, as well as snacks during the day, appetizers and drinks in the early evening and late night dessert. Our room was spacious and had a lovely view of the Telegraph Hill. Service was exceptional. We would return in a heartbeat."
"Excellent breakfast at the hotel's restaurant. Fresh fruit, smoked thick cut bacon and eggs cooked perfectly. The rooms have been renovated recently and the minibar/coffee station has all you need while working at computer in room. Service is impeccable. "
"My husband and I have stayed at this property over the years but had not returned since the recent remodel. Beautiful rooms with premium furnishings, classic service and friendly staff throughout the hotel. Ritz Carlton is THE finest hotel in San Francisco."
"Was here for a business conference. The hotel staff, cleanliness, business rooms, food and setting were exceptional.However there were 2 drawbacks for me:The hotel doesn't have a swimming pool which does let it down as it does have a spa.Also I was in Room 214 and the bathroom didn't work properly. Everything seemed a little bit dated. E.g. The shower was in the bath, it was a pull up shower / bath mixer tap and when I pulled it up on every occasion the bath filled with water and the shower wasn't very powerful. Let the hotel down considerably."
"Stay here every time I come to SF. Love the club level. Wonderful service and food - unparalleled. Clean room, timely early checkin, accommodated all requests. Checkin, concierge, location, service, checkout, club level, all terrific. Fitness center could be a bit upgraded."
Have stated here several times this time left the kids behind and wanted an intimateWeekend alone and servedHad an auction won certificate upgraded to club levelDefinitely worth itThe food wine service all includedAnd the breakfast was greatWill come backLoved the room great view of the bayHad a great timeNever worried about foodNever went out to a restaurantWe live hereAnd we were goodGreat serviceLove the ritz
"They truly do deliver. 5 star service incredible accommodations wonderful location. We did a ""staycation"" in our own city and upgraded to the consouir lever( definitely recommend) food and wine and open bar in a giant open space on the 8th floor was a nice welcome home after shopping all day. We used love the Ritz because of the swimming pool I am continually disappointed that they took it out to put in an unused excessive room and the locker rooms could be updated to included a jacuzzi. Overall a great place to stay well appointed rooms and nice overall rehab or the hotel. We would go back again and again"
"I have stayed here twice and both times I have enjoyed my stay. The rooms seem to be freshly decorated, modern with a hint of Art Deco. The staff is very friendly and the two bars are great. Location is very central and convenient. internet has always worked and was fast. The concierge was very helpful helping me get to the Warriors game. I will stay here again and so far the best of the chain hotels I have found in SF."
"As far as luxury-Marriott CA travel goes, I have stayed at this Ritz, the Ritz Half Moon Bay about 35 minutes away and the Ritz Marina in LA. The valet at this particular Ritz in San Fran proper were quite rude and judged us based on our skin color and how we were dressed when we requested our car. I've never received 20 questions from valet before while being judged and quizzed to see if the vehicle was really mine, but it happened here, especially as Platinum Elite. It's the only hotel I've ever been to that we've had that issue so I would not return to this property.I normally stay at the San Francisco Marquis or the Omni now because of the blatant disrespect by the Ritz Carlton San Francisco's valet. The rooms were smaller but very comfortable with large tubs and great views of SF. Room service was incredible and they had free alcoholic ""fog"" drinks in the lobby."
"We loved our stay at the Ritz in San Francisco. The rooms were beautiful and the entire staff made us feel like home and they went out of their way to accommodate us. Many high end hotels in San Fran have very small rooms, but the size of the rooms at the Ritz were large. We will definitely be back!"
"We stayed for 3 nights in September 2016.This is a luxurious hotel well located for walking into China Town, sight seeing and shopping. Upon arrival, Roe, on the desk recommended us upgrading to a special rate that covers breakfast and parking. It's a good tip. The room was spacious and beautifully decorated with city views. There is free wifi and coffee making facilities. Breakfast is excellent. Served in the restaurant with full menu available. Recommended for a luxurious sight seeing trip"
"We stayed at the Ritz during our 20th anniversary trip. The rooms were well appointed, clean and comfortable. The hotel was in a great location to walk or drive to many attractions around the city. Our favorite part of our experience was the staff. Everyone was very helpful and friendly throughout our trip. I'd especially like to compliment Jen the bartender in the Lounge. She was super friendly and gave us so much helpful information not only about San Francisco sights and restaurants but also about the many choices in Napa as well. We found ourselves checking in with her before our nights out to see what her opinion was on our restaurant and bar choices and she was spot on every time! She made a special trip away for two tired parents even better and she's a credit to the hotel. Thanks to the Ritz San Francisco. We'd definitely love to stay again some day."
"What a wonderful stay at the San Francisco Ritz-Carlton. The location was perfect, the room so beautiful, and the service impeccable. We also enjoyed a nice wine tasting in the wine room. I look forward to returning in the near future."
"I had always wanted to stay at a Ritz Carlton since hearing a talk from a service ambassador a few years ago, and was excited for this stay.Unfortunately it was average at best, particularly for the room price, but to be fair I don't think the young professional market is their demographic. That is my reason for 3 stars as a lot about the stay was good, just not excellent.The service was great, if at times a little overbearing, however there was definitely no personalization or anticipation of needs that I had heard so much about. I also unfortunately needed to chase up twice errors on my final account which was a frustrating waste of time.Rooms: were quite spacious, with nice touches like a USB charger beside bed. Bathrooms are quite dated, I personally hate a shower over bath.Breakfast had a great range of options, but in room dining wasn't great - I'd probably just go with a meal delivery service rather than choose this againAll in all this was just a mis-match in expectations, I at least ticked off my list but won't be staying at a ritz Carlton again "
"The Ritz Carlton / S.F. has outstanding service at every level, and all staff members are incredibly accommodating and welcoming.. Our room had recently been refurbished, and was absolutely lovely. Everything was spotless, and the bed was incredibly comfortable. Great bar too. The location is walking distance to Union Square, Chinatown and North Beach. We HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL!"
"Beautiful hotel with excellent service. Concierge desk was particulary helpful in arranging several outings. ""The Lounge"" was so fun for our pre and/or post dinner drinks. The hotel restaurant, Parallel 37, offered a delicious breakfast buffet. The fitness center was well stocked with all kinds of equipment. Our room was spacious and very clean. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud. Exceptional customer service is what defines this hotel. We will definitely return! "
"Staff are wonderful. Good location - a well appointed hotel. We always have a nice time when we stay here. The lounge is fun. It has a nice gym and a spa. The spa is small. If you are looking for a big hotel with shops, restaurants and lots of rooms - this isn't your place."
"Stayed up on the 8th floor club lounge and this place was off the hook. The personnel up there took very good care of us and we cannot wait to go back. Breakfast, Lunch, dinner and after hours.. they had everything that we could ask for. Mark Jill & Matt"
"The staff are extremely well trained. Some of the best i have encountered in the world. They did not miss a beat and always called you by your name if they had previous contact. Rooms very well appointed, spacious bathrooms and very light. My only real ""beef"" was breakfast. Poor range of choices, not enough seating, hot food on buffet was luke warm or in some cases cold. Overall the breakfast for a hotel of such caliber was very disappointing.BTW great gym and beautiful lobby bar! Would recommend but maybe have breakfast somewhere else."
"When you arrive tired after a long drive and you need sympathetic treatment, an easy check in, a valet for your car and a decent cocktail, this hotel appears like an oasis in an otherwise fairly dry dessert for good hotels. We had a 3 person suite for a night in April 2017 which was quite huge and easily accommodated the extra bed in the lounge area of living room. Service is extraordinarily polite, charming and effective. No hotel in New York comes close to the quality of the staff that we saw here.Food is also really well crafted. Room service for 3 was $200 and you can argue that's expensive but it was no hardship relative to the quality.The hotel looks like it's had a recent refurb and all the details from wifi, wide screen TVs, showers work without grumbles. Has this become a favourite? Definitely. Is it worth the price? Yes. Can they try harder? We can all try harder but this team is trying very hard indeed."
"I stayed at the hotel for 4 nights in April and I will say the service is pretty good. The check in desk can get a bit crowded when multiple guests are checking in at the same time. Rooms are nicely decorated and in good condition since they were renovated not too long ago. The bathrooms on the other hand are original: Old, unpolished, water stained marble and some of the floor tiles are loose. This should have been part of the renovation. One other item, regardless of rewards elite status, hotel is very stingy with upgrades. They are trained to say they are sold out even when they are ready, willing and able to sell them through their reservations department. I am Platinum Premiere and was still denied. The Club Level is nice with excellent staff and the presentations are good but for sure other Ritz Clubs offer more extensive presentations and, at the price point, this one should too.Overall it is a nice hotel and I would return."
"Fabulous stay in a spacious, bright, beautiful one bedroom (king bed) suite. Impeccably renovated property. Beautiful neoclassical terra cotta exterior with brand new top to bottom luxurious, tastefully decorated interior. Big windows. Quiet. Excellent service. Coffee, apples and fortune cookies in the lobby. Attentive staff everywhere from the bellmen to housekeeping staff. Top notch toiletries. Convenient location. Excellent in every way. Exceeded expectations."
The Ritz in San Francisco is an all around great property. The lobby and check in area is beautiful and welcoming. One of the most amazing locations with a great vantage point for anywhere in the city.
"Ladies and Gentlemen serving Ladies and Gentlemen. Beautiful hotel in a fabulous city, great bed for a restful night sleep, delicious breakfast, what more could you ask for? It is on a steep hill so if you are intimidated by driving up hills, my advice is use Uber."
"We arrived around 4pm and had to wait for about a half hour until our room was ready, and we were certainly not alone in that. Our housekeeper was excellent, but we were a little disappointed in the lack of attentiveness by the rest of the staff. There was nothing terrible about our stay, but that being said there wasn't really anything spectacular either. The room was nice and the bed was comfortable, but at Ritz pricing I guess we were a little underwhelmed. The hotel is in a great location central to many areas of the city. Overall we had no real complaints just were not blown away. "
"Family and i had an exceptional stay here. we took 4 roomsthe rooms were large and comfortable.the first time you just sink into the bed and say ""ahhhhh"" is a great feeling.staff was always smiling and there to help and serve. they are all very pleasant to deal with the only reason why i didnt rate it 5 stars, there were some cosmetic issues in our rooms. small piece of wallpaper peeling, small stains in the bathrooms etc. not supposed to be like that in the high class hotel.in addition, the 1st day we arrived, there was a $80 voucher on my bed for breakfast which was pleasantly surprising, The next day we went to breakfast had some cereal and drinks nothing too heavy and at check out i was billed almost $100. yes i was in shock and no i did not save the voucher. after discussing with the front desk they did credit me back $50. so it was a semi-sour way to leave the hotel.other than that, it was great. and we can't wait to go back to the hotel."
"This hotel is our go-to hotel whenever we go to SF, so much so that the staff and valets recognize us by name which is a nice ego-boosting factoid, but regardless we recommend it to all. The house restaurant is excellent, but seriously, if you're in SF, hit the great places everywhere (but make reservations way ahead...the hotel concierge can help with suggestions before you arrive). Get a room on or above the 5th floor, since the lobby is on the 4th floor. If it's a busy time, prices can be a bit stiff, but if you're flexible, you might find lower prices or packages. But if quality over cost equals value, you'll be happy regardless."
"I was in SFO staying at the Ritz Carlton and attending a conference there when there was a massive power outage in the business district causing the Ritz and several blocks around it to lose all power. The staff handled the situation with grace and skill. In addition to the Ritz's usual high standards of service, this put the entire staff to the test and never once did I get the impression they were less than prepared and they handled the situation in stride"
"Stayed at both properties in the same week. Ritz service and property disappointed. Lowes was spectacular. I'm usually a Ritz guy. This hotel lacked usual service, welcoming feeling and room looked at a wall for 475 a night"
"It is always great how the Ritz finds historical properties in the best of locations. What I will never forget is the great service of the concierge staff, and especially the ladies and gentlemen of the Club Level. Starsky and a hispanic gentleman made my stay there extra special, from the warm welcome to the fond farewell. Superb!"
"Exceptional stay with family and kids in SF. Great location, fabulous staff and drinks. Will for sure come back again! Could not have had a better experience at the Ritz. Clean, spacious, great location."
"The Ritz-Carlton San Francisco is a lovely property. The customer service and attention to detail is unparalleled. The staff are helpful, courteous, engaging, and lovely to speak with. Our stay was short, but lovely. The choice of amenities cater to business or pleasure."
Had a great one night stay. Great location. Staff was wonderful and attentive. Didn't get to eat there but had a very good martini at the bar. Love the decor in the rooms. Nice turndown service. Nice stay!!
"My wife and I spent one night at this hotel on 4/22. The service was impeccable (always being addressed by name), the decor was modern but discrete. The hotel staff even had chocolate covered fruits delivered to our room for our special day. A truly enjoyable and unique experience. We highly recommend the Ritz-Carlton San Francisco!"
Great location and historic property Club level service is amazing Safe neighborhood close to cable car stop and walking distance to shopping One restaurant on property is the one limitation but close to others
"Sincerily, i dont have nothing to say more than excellent stay, i stay before at many Ritz Carlton, and untill now, the Ritz Carlton San Francisco, is the best of the bests, specialy at the club level, they are specials people, make you feel at home, specials thanks for all the team atbthe club level"
RC SF remains an outstanding choice for business or pleasure travel. Excellent staff and level of service. Decor renovations missed the mark for us (we preferred the more traditional style of the prior decor). Club staff are exceptional!
Fried food is cooked twice in pork fat apparently- food swimming in fat. Not edible. Initial room was level with the street and the noise and honking horns were deafening. The manager did move us to another room facing a quiet street. If you stay here make sure you request room with no street nose and plan on eating somewhere else unless you like pork fat.
"Great location, hotel front desk very attentive. Had an issue and resolved quickly. Was given an upgrade for 3 of the nights! Room was very clean and spacious for SanFran. Trolls car right outside. Top notch!"
"Had the chance to stay here on a trip I joined the Utah Jazz and their owners while in town to play the Warriors. The hotel was great, easy to get around, very nice, and the staff was excellent. What you would expect at the Ritz-Carlton."
"Location- Stockton and California, right on cable line. Only negative might be that their is not much a view from most rooms as hotel is 9 floors only surrounded by buildings. Service- We have stayed at many Ritz Hotels and I have to say this might be the best. Easter baskets for the kids, dinner reservations/ recommendations, rollaway bed, directions, complimentary car service (within 1 mile of the hotel) all spot on. Never a need for a second or third request.Rooms- Well appointed, club level suite was huge. Very quiet. Dinning- Club level, very good, nice selection. Lobby bar area (lunch), outstanding. Spa/Fitness- Did not use but looked typical of Ritz.Overall- If SF is your destination you should consider this property. Many hotels claim a 5 star rating this one actually delivers. The club level is not cheap but in our opinion worth the value. "
"Although this was not our first stay at the Ritz Carlton, San Francisco, as always it was an experience to remember. The staff always greets us by name and remembers conversations from our last visits. It really makes you feel as if you are truly welcomed by old friends. The suite we were given was so beautiful and well appointed and the club staff as always greet us by name and with welcoming hugs as they anticipate our every need. We were there celebrating our wedding anniversary and they did so much to make the occasion special including a bottle of my wife's favorite champagne in our room. This level of service will always keep us coming back."
"We were given the Sir Hillary room because it was.our anniversary. The room is filled wirh historic artifacts and furnishings. The hotel's location is great. We had easy acess to San Francisco 's notable sites. Geat service, too."
Our Spring Break trip with our two sons was vastly enhanced by choosing to stay at the Ritz Carlton. They anticipated our every need and genuinely were concerned with our family having a wonderful experience. I highly recommend. 
We stayed at the Ritz on the club level for several days while on vacation in April. We couldn't have been more satisfied. The club level was particularly nice -- well stocked with food and drinks. A couple nights our kids were too tired to go out to dinner and the apps and snacks were more than enough to make a meal.
Great hotel...the staff does a wonderful job keeping the property clean. The rooms are an adequate size and the bed was very comfortable. Great coffee machine in the room. The staff was friendly and helpful. I recommend this hotel. 
"Room located above the entrance to the hotel - 7th floor. Could hear the cable car but it wasn't bothersome at all. Room is spacious and beds are very comfortable. Easy walking distance to North Beach and Chinatown. It was frustrating to come back from a 6 mile walk today, drenched by the rain, and have the doorman stand there, look at me and consciously decide not to open the door. Guess I didn't look wealthy enough to fawn over. First thing I did when I got to my room was check the bathroom to see if the hairs that were in the corner of the bathroom when we arrived yesterday had been cleaned up. Nope. Still there. I like the hotel but the service needs some work."
"I spent 30+ nights staying in Marriot hotels during the year for business. I saved all of my frequent stay points for a special getaway in san fran with my wife. Instead of splitting my 80,000 points and getting 2 mediocre hotels, I used them all at the finest hotel for one night. I was not disappointed. I made the right choice. This hotel was amazing in comfort and style. I impressed my wife so much, that she no longer cares that I spent 30+ nights away on business. The room was amazing!!!"
"Immediately when entering the building you are flooded with service, which is exactly what you would expect out of a brand like Ritz. Everyone was trained very well and more than accommodating. We got there early around 1030 am and they immediately gave us a room, which was very nice considering check in wasn't until 4 pm. We greatly appreciated that since it was our last day on our honeymoon and we wanted to explore San Francisco. The room was on a corner so a ton of natural light from both walls coming in. The view was nice as well looking right down into Chinatown and the business district. Rooms had a contemporary design, which fits my personal preference very well. Later that evening we went to the lounge area where they had a nice bar and again service was good there as well. If your a guy looking for a lady who is looking for a sugar daddy, that would be the bar to sit at. I couldn't help but be entertained by overhearing the comments and stories of these two cougars trials and tributes as they made plays at any older guy with a nice watch that came up to the bar. Checkout process was seamless and the bellman at both the arrival and departure was phenomenal. Those guys really have it together. "
"This is our favorite hotel in San Francisco and we have been using this property for the past three years and will continue to stay there. The hotel is beautifully maintained, service is wonderful and they make an effort to be personable. The food quality at the restaurant is very high, it truly is a farm to table kind of restaurant. Most impressive was the breakfast buffet that I usually try to avoid. The Eggs Benedict was fresh, egg was not dry and the muffin was crisppy. I discover their secret, they replace the whole tray with fresh one even when the the existing tray was still half full. It seems they change it every 15 minutes or so. That is paying attention to details and why the quality of their food is so high. "
"I stay at over one hundred hotels a year for work and this is among my favorite places to stay. The rooms are well maintained, the service is outstanding and the food is excellent. It also has the fastest wi-fi that I have ever seen at a hotel.This is the best city Ritz Carlton."
