Review
"What a great sleep. Good honestly friendly service from when You enter and a very homely feel to the room, and for New York something quite different - A balcony you can actually use. Friendly Christine tried what she could to getme a nice room even though I was early. Later the rest the team were equally helpfull,when it turne out that my online cloth order had been split into 6 bits. They had no problems with it all, even smiled about in a nice way. hope they enjoyed rhe chocolates. Good location close to more local neighbourhood on Lexington and obviously The UN and Grand Central. Uhhh most importantly I suppose; It was amazing to lie in bed and watch as the sun made its way around the room. What a good sleep."
"The rooms were clean and the personnel were helpful and professional. It is downtown New York, so a window with a view of a brick wall is very possible. Grand Central Station was an eight minute walk away, and the subway was even closer. There is a grocery store and wine store one block over."
"just arrived home from our fab stay in New York, stayed at the hilton for 4 nights , cannot fault this hotel at all.. room was more spacious than we were expecting , very clean , had everything you need including a coffee machine , theres a dunkin donuts across the road just past the irish bar if u fancy a latte and breakfast opens at 5 am , fresh towels and toiletries daily , staff welcoming , close to times square , we enjoyed the walk daily with lots of shops along the way ,we did get a taxi on our last night due to the rain,, was only 5 dollars, would stay here again and hope to do so very soon, thank you for a pleasant ,enjoyable stay"
"Our bath wasn’t working the first night, the second day our safe wasn’t working, and when opened by the manager, we discovered money had been taken. As if things couldn’t get worse our bathroom flooded on the Sunday night, the staff were disgusting and rude and were not quick to help us move rooms despite items being damaged THEN they tried to say we trashed our own hotel room and took $250 of our card without telling us! Phoned Hilton numerous times and they don’t want to know so had to phone my solicitor in England! Have evidence of the way we were treated and images of the room yet they still didn’t care! Can’t wait for my solicitors actions! Worst holiday experience ever! "
"This hotel has been here awhile. However, they’ve kept it up nicely. The staff is very professional and friendly. The rooms have everything you need. Only con, the ice machines are on the 2nd and 8th floors only. Nice place, great location."

"I have wasted lot of time looking for a laundry service as there is none in the hotel, the ones they have leaves at saturdays 9:30 am, and then you don't have any other option (neither assistance from the desk). The shower doors open alone, so everything gets wet and there is no place to put your soap or shampoo... This is like a 2 stars hotel :S I hope my company can book me another one for my following stays."
"The hotel was nearly a mile from Times Square, where I needed to be in NY, but that is not what the woman told me on the phone when I booked the room. I was told it was ""not that far"". Instead of being transferred to the Hilton right in Times Square, this person decided it was better for her to get my business - never again - and the beds were not of the usual Hilton comfort. I got a terrible night's sleep. "
My husband was on a business trip I joined him we stayed here at this hotel. Location was excellent the staff was very friendly and efficient. I have no problem staying here again was well worth it. Close to Times Square and other tourist attractions the M42 bus stop is in front of the hotel. 
My wife and I had a very nice and enjoyable stay at this very conveniently located hotel in Midtown New York. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the rooms nice and clean. We would definitely stay there again. 
"I went on a family trip and it was amazing, I hope to come back soon. The room was small but what can you expect from New York. It was close to many things and the staff was perfect.I will come back again soon."
"Stayed here with my boyfriend for four nights, nice hotel. Didn’t have breakfast included so can’t comment on that. All staff very pleasant, rooms cleaned every day new towels every day. No complaints from us two. Wouldn’t come to New York again though. "
"Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights over new year 2017. It is in a good location, about a 10min walk from grand central station (depending how quick you walk). Door men and reception staff are friendly and very helpful. However we were very disappointed in the room. The room decor was rather confused. Bed was comfy and a good range of channels on the tv. Good sized wardrobe. But the shower pressure wasn't very strong, and the handrail in the shower was in an awkward position. But the bathroom was a good long size (although not very wide when using the toilet). The furniture was a mixture of white clean 'modern' and very dark (could call it old looking) should have been one or the other. The gym was average for city hotel not a lot of weights and a few cardio machines We enjoyed our stay but if we were to go again we probably would find somewhere else to stay."
"I choose to stay at this hotel every time I go to NYC now. I selected it at first because of convenient proximity to work, but keep coming back because the staff is awesome (Christina and Jaime at the front desk are the BEST!). The best room I have ever had in NYC is also at this hotel and fortunately it has been available both of the last two times I stayed here. I would say what room it was but, well, that just may affect it's availability for me in the future so I'll just recommend you stay here yourself and find your own favorite room."
"very pleasant, Clean friendly environment defiantly will recommend and plan on coming back as a guest for my next trip to New York city. Also Christine was super helpful in getting me and my family situated!! "
"To start this is NOT a Hilton property. It is owned by a company by the name of TPG. As a Gold member for Hilton who travels a great deal in many cases where the property is not owned by Hilton I find it is not up to Hiltons standards.This hotel is truly horrible. Rooms are old and dark. Hotel interior is the same way. Bathroom is tiny, and in my case the shower did not work.As I was leaving the hotel I stopped by the front desk to tell them about my experience. After had done so I mentioned to the person at the front desk that the hotel was the worst I had ever stayed at. The person behind the front desks reply was ""i do not doubt it"". Guess that says it all.Stay at another hotel. You will be happy you did."
I recently stayed here right before New Year's. I bought a suite to have a romantic few days in the city with my girlfriend. This hotel was terrible. The staff was rude there was no Management on hand to complain to. The room had many issues and was not clean. Finally when I got back home I complained to Hilton they've directed my comments back to the hotel management who moreless said oh well... I stay at Hilton for business and pleasure but this hotel and the response I got back from Hilton and the hotel are making me rethink that. Stay somewhere else this hotel is not worth it.
"I found this little hotel to be a “Hidden Gem” of the Hilton NY Family. Just a few blocks from Grand Central Station on 42nd East and 2nd Ave, it resides in the renovated historic Tutor Hotel. The hotel was immaculate and kept to a historic 1920s theme. I stayed in a king room and found it to be quite spacious for a NYC boutique hotel. My window faced the side of the building and I suspect rooms facing front may have better views. The hotel is also located across the street from McFaddens 2nd Ave bar and grill. The staff was friendly and attentive. Best of all, priced at $125 a night it was a deal. I’m a Hilton Honors Member and I’ve come to expect the best from Hilton Properties and this certainly met and exceeded it."
"Showered in an inch of water. Windows have leaks that let air in. No room service for lunch or dinner. (You can order takeout with ease.) New pillows needed. Great location and SUPER staff, but the physical hotel itself is not to the standard of a Hilton. There are plenty of places to stay in NYC. Look elsewhere."
Great location. Fantastic staff. Spacious room. Great value for Manhattan. Nice intimate feel to this property. Valet parking was reasonable for Manhattan. Helpful bellmen and front desk staff. Would stay here again. 
"The location is great. Right in the middle of everything. Short drive to the places we wanted to go and felt very safe. When we checked in the gentlemen at the desk was very polite and nice. There was another guy as well in the afternoon that worked back to back that was always polite. The breakfast was okay. It could have been better. Also, one of my friends called down for towels and they have been taking a while, when she called the front desk she stated ""its been 30 min and the towels haven't been delivered."" the girl who answered said ""its actually been 15 min, and they are on its way"" regardless if its been 15-30 min, that was a bit rude... she should be better trained on her customer service skills. Other than that overall good stay."
"My wife and I recently stayed here for five nights on a holiday. The room was beautiful, the bed was the best I have ever slept in (and I stay in hotels 200 plus nights per year due to my job), staff were very helpful and friendly and it was very clean with quality toiletries. .I am glad I didn't take too much notice of all the negative comments I had seen before booking or I may have missed out on this hotel which would have been a pity.When in NY again I will stay here as it's walking distance to Grand Central and buses on 2nd Avenue just outside. Great Hotel / no complaints at all."
"Of all the ""nice"" hotel chains I stay at this is the first time I've been in a room that really needed a good cleaning. Oh the carpet was vacuumed and the linens were clean, but the rest was severely lacking. For a Hilton, unacceptable. The shelf in the closet hadn't been wiped off in a decade, and the filters, which are right above your head if you sit at the desk, may have never been replaced, the amount of dust/dirt on the air return was ridiculous, you'd be blind not to notice it. There was also a hole in the ceiling of the bathroom with what appears to be rust and the grout in the bath had a number of spots of mold/mildew. I appreciate that the price for this hotel is cheaper than others, but I'll pay a few more dollars for a clean space. I can not recommend you stay here, find another hotel."
"Being a frequent business traveller across continental Europe I stay in different hotels and Hilton was always my preferred choice because of excellent cost/quality ratio.So when it came to planning our family trip to NY Hilton somehow seemed a natural and safe choice for me. How I was wrong... This hotel was bad in every possible way. Upon arrival I filed a complaint on Hilton's web site. And guess what - I received a meaningless snide response, from the front desk of Hilton Grande Central. You got it? My complain was routed to the same people to whom I was actually complaining! What a joke!Since I don't expect any actions on behalf of the Hilton management any more, I quote here my quite detailed complaint. Maybe it would help someone to avoid the same mistake I did - staying in Hilton Grand Central. This stay was my the most unpleasant stay in Hilton hotels worldwide and probably of any hotel where I stayed. 1. The staff was very rude, incompetent and showed no wish to assist in any way. One employee which stood out (in the worst possible way) was a gentleman named Matthew. He even didn't bother to say simple ""hello"" neither when we first arrived nor any time during our stay when we encountered him at the front desk. Whenever we approached him with a request he always tried to do his best to avoid interacting with us. 2. During check-in I told the reception staff that our luggage was lost and we'd need some basic hygiene supplies (toothbrush, etc.). Never heard back from them. 3. Due to flight delay we arrived early on the next day after initial arrival date. We learned that our reservation was cancelled and we had to wait until another room was found. No-one made any attempt to get in touch with us (either via phone or email). I'd want to remind that our complete stay was fully paid in advance! Moreover, I actually called the hotel on initial date of arrival and informed about flight delay.3. A package was sent on my name to the hotel. Despite the fact that tracking clearly showed that the package was delivered to the front desk, the hotel staff never found it. I received no package and even not an apology for the loss. 4. Two days prior to checkout our room keys were disabled and we were not able to enter the room. Front desk employee confirmed that they cancelled the keys and reenabled them after several strong requests. 5. Air conditioning in the room was faulty and extremely noisy to the point when it woke us up at night. All decorations were removed from all walls.The door lock was nearly punched out. I have stayed numerous times in Hilton hotels in Europe. When planning this NY trip the Hilton was my first choice. Not any more."
"Compared to other stays in Hilton brand hotel, the staff in this hotel did not value us as a gold member. First, he did not greet us properly and did not tell us any benefit of gold member. Second, he only gave us breakfast vouchers for one day without checking how many days we were gonna stay (we stayed for two nights). After we checked out our luggages with one of the staff, the other staff came forward ask us who checked out our stuff in a very rude way. We have a ticket to retrieve our luggages, is it matter who is the one checked our stuff out? Because of his long questioning, we missed our bus!!!! Super upset with our stay in Hilton Grand Central."
It's really close to the grand central station a little over 5 mins walk. Rooms were small (usual in NYC) but clean. One of The Staff was very unfriendly though and acted like he did not want to be there. 
"We were upgraded to a kingsize suit which was very spacious. The balcony was large with partial views over the river. Very clean hotel throughout. All staff were friendly and very helpful. Able to leave bags all day without a problem. A very professionally run hotel, great location for walking to sights"
"Great location for such a good price. Got a good deal through the HH app. Was surprised to get such a good deal around NYE. Service was ok. I’m assuming the time of year and the hideous freezing weather was making it a little more difficult for them to be super welcoming but they were fine. It’s noisy outside but hey, you’re in Manhattan, that’s what happens! Just bring some earl plugs and you’ll be fine. It’s a pity there’s no vending machine as the little store closes usually before you come back at night. However there’s a little corner store nearby that has fantastic black and white cookies. If you can get the same good deal then I’d recommend this hotel! "
"This hotel is in a great location, however rooms are small and out of date with the fixtures. They’re slightly difficult to manage, mostly the shower. However it is okay because you tend to spend most the time out in the city and not in the room."
"I stayed at this Hilton property for 13 nights so I would like to share my feedback with fellow travellers and team members of the hotel. Let’s first start with the POSITIVES. - Great Location- Bell desk staff is always on point and very helpful and literally go out of the way for their guests.- comfortable rooms -Amazing pillows- great toiletries - fast elevators  NEGATIVES-When I was checking in my credit card was charged for the security amount as I received a message from my bank instantly. When I asked the gentleman on the front desk he replied by saying that it is mandatory for them to charge me for security purposes just in case if there is any loss, damage or extras during my stay. He clearly did not know what he was talking about. You are never allowed to charge a guest for any of that. You are only allowed to block an amount which can only be charged once the stay is complete and if there is any loss or damage to the property or if I have purchased any chargeable items during my stay. Unprofessional. - Most of the people working in the front office just look so fed up with their jobs. The first rule of hospitality is to greet your guest with a smile. Not once did I see that from any individual working there. In fact they made it seem like it was them doing you a favour if you ever approached them for anything. - As soon as I checked in I noticed there were no complimentary water bottles in the room. If I have paid so much to stay in your hotel the least you can do is provide me with a bottle or two of water everyday in my room. If I have paid so much to stay in your hotel it is but obvious that I can go and purchase a bottle of water however it is normal for any guest to expect a little decency on the part of the hotel to provide the same in the room. I’m sure it wouldn’t cost much. It just made things inconvenient. For the first few days I had to go down to the front office and ask for a bottle of water. Had it been any other property they would have been ashamed and placed it in my room without me asking again. Finally, one day the Asian gentleman on the front desk told me he cannot give me a bottle of water because I am not a ‘Hilton Diamond member’. Isn’t that pathetic? Usually all hilton properties keep 2 complimentary bottles of water in every room.I could have called him out on that nonsense instantly. Cause it seemed more like a property issue of cost cutting rather than a Hilton issue as mentioned. However I I did not call him out on that and I will tell u why later on in this review. Let’s move on for now. - No Room Service- No Minibar in the rooms-Beyond outdated television - The toilet door gets jammed and if you lock the door then it’s beyond difficult to unlock it again. - The telephones in the room are pointless because whenever you call any department nobody answers your call. -Housekeeping should knock and check if there is a guest before entering the room. I practically had to keep a DND sign outside my room every night so that the HK lady does not just waltz into my room unannounced. -Air freshener the HK uses is extremely strong and can be harsh for those who are sensitive to them. The smell isn’t too appealing too. -Stained sheets: I received a few stained sheets ie my bed linen and that just seemed very unhygienic.-No heater in the toilet. It’s like your stepping into a walk-in freezer. (Guys, it’s -10 outside. Fix the heater or make arrangements for a new one to be installed. It’s very uncomfortable as you can imagine.)- I was a long staying guest not once did anyone bother to ask me how my stay was going, if I needed anything or any general feedback which would help them serve guests better in the future. None of that.-Finally, on the last day I requested the Asian gentleman who was the front office to kindly give me a late checkout. I stayed for 13 nights. I know it’s hotel policy to only give late checkout based on availability, demand for the day and supply for the day. However since i checked out on January 2nd I did notice a lot of people leaving to go back. Hence, my request. It was shot down instantly. All he had to do was go on ONQ and leave a trace so that I could be comfortable for a few additional hours while I waited for my car to go to the airport. I was offered only an hour additional in a very a rude tone and hence I decided not to take it and checked out earlier than the check out time the next day. I know this review is harsh but I’d like to give a bit of background about who I am. I am an ex Hilton employee. I have worked in each and every department of Hilton Mumbai International Airport while I was doing my training. I have also worked with Kempinski in Geneva while I have done my Masters in Hospitality Management from Glion in Switzerland. I am also a partner in one of the most prominent hotel chains in India. As you can imagine I do hold the needed credentials.I do understand that the hotel is a very old property and sometimes the management may not have the necessary authority to make the updates/upgrades required. However it is the managements duty to provide service to a guest and it is the General managers duty to see that his/her hotel functions in a smooth manner where his staff and his guests are having a good experience. Unfortunately I did not see any of that. I understand that the holiday period is a busy period and you must have been sold out and probably overworked on some days. But that is no excuse for poor service and below average management. If I just wanted to pay for a room I would have stayed in an ibis or similar property and saved a lot of money. But I decided to stay at the Hilton New York grand central. Did I get my money’s worth? Absolutely not. I think everyone at the Hilton New York grand central need to pull up their socks. Take a page from the bell desk staff and most of all be passionate about what you do because if your not then that trickles down to your guests and in return you will get more reviews like this in the future and that can be very damaging. Beyond disappointed."
"our bathroom lacked any heat source, compounded by a broken window and -5 degree temperatures outside. not only wasn't the baseboard heater fixed, as the manager had promised, but there was no message upon our late return to the room of apology or accommodation to another room making for a most miserable stay"
"We visited over a late December weekend, and it was frigid outside. Unfortunately, it was also frigid inside our guest room. Hotel staff was responsive, but there was nothing more they could do to remedy the problem. The guest room furnace could not get the temperature above 69 degrees....with the draft through the old windows, this was too cold for our family to rest peacefully. The bathroom radiator did not function at all - cold tub and frozen tile floors were uncomfortable. Also, the lobby cafe/bar/restaurant is only open select hours, so coffee, hot water, and other snacks are not as available as you might expect. Other notes: Our rate included parking, however this means that you can park but not use your car without a separate charge. We were told to leave it in the garage for the duration of our stay. Finally, the entrance does not have any ramps for strollers, wheelchairs, or luggage."
Please be aware that if you chose to book your reservation through a third party like expedia that this hotel does not like that and the staff will treat you differently than if you book through the Hilton website.
"We spend one night here since we had an overnight layover in NYC. It's a great location- within walking distance of Times Square, etc. (Might be subjective- we ended up getting a taxi a few times since it was cold and I had a foot injury- but it only cost $6-$10 to get most places). Customer service is ABSOLUTELY STELLAR- from the front desk (thank you, Matthew, for taking care of us!) to the doormen to the housekeeping staff to the servers in the restaurant. These people are some of the best I've encountered. Lobby and restaurant areas are really nice. Breakfast buffet was very good (eggs, bacon, oatmeal, juices, etc)-- I probably wouldn't have paid for it, but we got the breakfast included in the rate we paid, so we were delighted with it. So far, so good.The room- I really have mixed feelings on this one. Pros: the hotel is a historic property, which normally I love. The rooms have old-fashioned granite/marble countertops in the bathroom, some vintage furniture, crown molding, etc. This is the stuff I crave. Nice assortment of art, including a Toulouse Lautrec print. Room was pretty clean.Cons: Seriously, this room needed a lot of help. We got a Jr suite (room 711), which still felt relatively cramped for the 3 of us -- hard to judge because NYC hotel rooms are microscopic compared to the rest of the country. The furniture was ""vintage"", but not ""antique store"" vintage- more like ""thrift store"" vintage. The gorgeous dresser had huge gouges and scrapes on it. The sleeper sofa was more like a sleeper loveseat, and was pretty sad. My 6'3"" son was pretty unimpressed with it. The heating vent had bunches of dustballs in it, one electrical outlet cover had a screw missing so it was starting to come off the wall, the bathroom door had a big chunk missing from the top corner- looks like the jagged edge was just painted over- etc. No fridge, no microwave. No linen or blankets for the sofa bed in the room- had to call to front desk at midnight (we had been to a Broadway show so didn't get in until late). Weird shower that requires directions to figure out. The room itself might have been okay for, say, a 3 star property or an independent place, but I really expected a lot more from a Hilton. It's also affiliated with the Historic Hotels of America- I've stayed in a few other properties on their list- and this one falls far short. I would definitely return if they refurbished the rooms, because other than the sub-par room quality, it was a great stay."
I was a bit scared about going to this hotel because of all the bad reviews. But the hotel was nice. Yes it's old and not perfect but it is a nice hotel for the money. The breakfast wasn't bad. The check in staff isn't very nice. We booked tow rooms and one of our rooms wasn't ready when we got there and after traveling 12 hours it would of been nice if it would have been. We went to go get dinner cause we were tired of waiting when we got back it was ready thank god. We we're all tired. The door man and the guy that parks your car or truck or van was nice. The waiters we had for breakfast was nice. It is a old hotel but it was clean. It is a long way to walk to time square and everything else but I think when you visit New York you need to know that wherever you go you have to walk. The subway wasn't that far. There is a bar/ restaurant across the street that is nice. But I think it's not all that bad of place to stay. The staff just needs to be be a little more friendlier and the rooms need to be ready for when you check in. Also breakfast they need to have chocolate milk and strawberry milk for the little children. We didn't see nothing that was that bad. The hotel isn't all that bad like some say. Hey for the money it's pretty good. Just need to kee in mind u need to wear comfortable shoes cause it's a little walk to everything but anywhere you go in New York is a walk. 
"Though the junior suite room had an odd assortment of furniture the hotel is pretty nice. The entire staff is outstanding and the entire hotel is spotless. Though the bar is small, the lobby is very welcoming. The breakfast was good. I do prefer eggs other than scrambled but the breakfast was good. Nice place and we enjoyed the location. Spotless and such an outstanding staff. Thanks to all the staff members for making our visit great."
"Not the best area of Manhattan with little going on or open at night. Stayed here because it was close to the ferry which helped us. The hotel is in serious need of an upgrade and does not live up to its Hilton brand namesake. Staff were helpful and accommodated 2 room changes for us (rooms were missing safes or far smaller than we had booked) and eventually put us in a suite. This room was run down, not very clean, had broken furniture, and though spacious, it was not worth the cost (even at the lower spec room price we paid). We wouldn't stay here again."
"Hotel is located in historic Tudor City building, with a lot of charm. Rooms are small but clean and very functional. Windows are double-glazed; if you need quiet ask for a room off the street and it will be fine. Staff is friendly and accommodating, especially the doormen. I did not eat the hotel breakfast, but chose to get coffee at one of the many coffee shops near the hotel. There are lots of restaurant choices within close walking distance. Keep in mind that this hotel is located away from the prime tourist area, but the subway at Grand Central is two blocks away and there is also a 42nd Street crosstown bus to Times Square and the theatre district. This hotel is a good choice if you want to locate away from the craziness of the tourist district. While perhaps not as fancy as some other Hilton properties in NYC, this is a solid, welcoming hotel and I would definitely recommend it."
"We spent 4 nights at this hotel in December 2017. It's a nice hotel, a little dated but clean and comfortable. The water was hot and everything worked great. I could not ever find vending machines and they sold $4-5 bottles of drinks in the lobby at certain hours. I also paid $9 for an egg muffin. I recommend stopping at CVS on the corner and buying some drinks/snacks and grabbing breakfast at Star Bucks up the road, if you can. The staff was all courteous and welcoming."
The staff at the Hilton was very nice and accommodating from the desk staff to the door man. The hotel is in great walking distance from Grand Central and good restaurants. short cab ride to Time Square.
"It is a long three blocks from Grand Central - however, it is walking distance from many places — the rooms vary in size so ask for an upgrade — look for a deal on the rooms — staff is friendly and helpful — this is a solid four star establishment not a great hotel but a solid one "
"We chose this Hotel because it was a Hilton and got it for a reasonable price. The location in Midtown-Manhattan is good, though next time I would prefer a location further west in Midtown. Flying in from La Guardia airport it was quite easy to get to the hotel by public transport since it's just a 10 minute walk from Grand Central Station.The staff was very friendly and helpful.The beds were comfortable, the room was clean, but rather old and though the room was pretty small, I would consider it reasonable for Manhattan. Though the rooms generally ok, I would not consider this Hotel to meet Hilton standards (which was the main reason we booked it). If booking into a Hilton is one of your main criteria, I would not recommend this Hotel. If you are just looking for a good, clean hotel with good beds and a decent Manhattan location, I can absolutely recommend it."
"We stayed at this Hilton Property since December 7th till December 11th. After having stayed at many Hiltons in New York I could say that this one will be my first choice next time.Front desk staff, concierge, breakfast staff all were not only friendly and accommodating but personable as well. I do not like those big hotels where one is not even looked at face.Here we were at the opposite side!. Each time we asked for something they went out of their way to help us. Always a smile, always a kind greeting.Rooms are not very big but we asked a Two Twin beds room and it was OK.I appreciete it has a window which is possible to open. Though it was cold many times I prefer outside air to aerate the room. Many places to keep clothes and luggage tided and a comfortable- though not very big- desk to work or study. Good lightening to read at bed and at work desk.Bathroom was big enough and, again, not luxurious but it also has a window.Housekeeping made early in the morning what I love.Wi-Fio works well but it is not on the quickest side.Breakfast was OK. Not many choices but you could find fruit, bread and American breakfast. Staff there very, very kind.Fitness center open 24 hours with your room key. Not very big: only two walking machines, one bike and an elliptic machine. Do not know if there are many people but as I get up early in the morning I could enjoy it.Location at first sight could look rather far always from many attractions but Metro station is two blocks away and Grand Central Station offers many possibilities. It is easy to walk from one side or the other of Fifth Avenue.I decidedly will have it in mind next time at NY.A common place with tables, with Wi-Fi and TV and coffee shop at Ground floor. A onbderful place to share!"
The jacuzzi did not work and no microwaves or fridges are included in the room. I did get a fridge after requesting it. There is no microwave for hotel guests to use unless an employee hears something in the employee microwave for you. 
"Make sure you ask about the $50/night security deposit they don’t tell you about when reserving the room. The reservations department will tell you there are none; however, they are there. The bathroom light didn’t work and after telling the front desk, no body was ever sent to fix it. The air barely works in room 718. I expected a little more for the price. It’s not the best Hilton I’ve been in. Just ok. "
"I stayed at this hotel for just one night over Thanksgiving weekend. I arrived a few hours prior to check-in. The friendly male front desk attendant explained that a room was not available, but that one should be available in about an hour. I opted to wait in the lobby. After about a half hour, the gentleman approached me in the lobby and explained my room was ready. Great customer service! He was very personable and friendly.My room was a typical size for NYC (small), clean, and quiet. The only odd thing was the faucets in the bathroom. I have never seen faucets like this before. They were old and difficult to use. There was actually a sign in the bathroom explaining how to turn on the shower.The hotel is located in the Tudor City neighborhood of Manhattan. It is located on East 42nd Street between 2nd Avenue and Tudor City Place. It is a quick walk to a multitude of restaurants, Grand Central Station and the United Nations.I enjoyed my stay at this hotel and would stay here again!"
We stayed for four nights. Of course the rooms were small. We signed up for a JrSuite with a pull out bed. They have not updated their website. We were moved to another room. The staff was nice. They gave us $100 off our first night and free breakfast for four days. Breakfast was great. Staff was very nice. We had to leave at 5:30 the departing day and nothing was available to eat at that time. Would stay here again.
"Have stayed here before and never disappointed. great location, walking distance to Grand Central and basically anywhere else. Quiet, well preserved building, great staff, friendly and very accommodating."
"Great location. Boutique feel. Friendly staff. I stayed on the second floor, which is where the gym is located, and it is a bit loud in the morning, so use the opportunity to choose your room. There is a small cafe, but I only utilized the coffee and take away at the shop. No room service."
"the location is nearley perfect. Far enough from the business of Grand Central and Time Square, but close enough to be convenient. Some nice restaurants in the area; good food, reasonable prices. Staff is freindly and helpful. Rooms are not large but appropriate."
"Amazing Staff, any of them would do anything to please and make you feel comfortable. The service is excellent and the hotel seems like have been renovated but preserving that type of historic look. The beds are very comfortable and the sheets feel so good. The breakfast is unbelievable! Nothing to complaint about it. I highly recommend it!"
"The Hilton Grand Central is in a great location for touring the city and easy access to transit. Hotel rooms could use a bit of updating, and construction behind the building is a bit loud (but that's NYC). There are only a few rooms per floor which is good because walls are really thin...we could almost join our neighbor's conversations."
"This is a beautiful hotel. Realizing that the hotel rooms are tiny in New York City, I was skeptical of a Jr. Suite, but the size did not disappoint. The doormen at this hotel were some of the best, most courteous, and sincere that I have experienced in a long time. One drawback that I would like to see addressed was that there were no in room mini-fridges for leftovers or cold beverages."
"Great place to stay. Room was clean and comfortable. Staff was very helpful with any request. Convenient to subway, excellent restaurants in the area, moderate walking distance to major city attractions."
"Unfortunately, my experience with the Hilton New York Grand Central is not indicative of my previous experiences as a Hilton Honors member. I paid approximately $800 for a two night stay and the rooms were not well -equipped for the price paid. I did not have a refrigerator or microwave, which is usually standard in Hilton Brands. Nor was their a community microwave residents could use. Several times following meals, I had to discard my food for lack of refrigeration or re-heating abilities. The lack of security was also apparent as well. The first night we were there, I viewed two men coming into the hotel and peeing in the front corner of the interior lobby area while intoxicated off the street. While walking towards our room, I had to inform the manager at the desk regarding the drunk men peeing and incapacitated in the front lobby. She addressed it immediately, but the late night manager clearly need more help. Additionally, several pieces of furniture was old and scratched, my bed linen skirt had stains along the bottom, and some of my electrical sockets did not work. Also, the Wi-Fi internet and TV signal was atrocious during the stay. I eventually quit watching or streaming anything while there. The hotel only had two ice machines for the 20 floor building and when I inquired about the location, I was told by the manager the machines may not work, go check and see? Lastly, some of the front desk staff varied from rude to unknowledgeable, with a dose of inattentiveness for guest waiting. I called in advance of my arrival seeking a early check-in and was told to keep calling back after offering to leave my number in case it was possible. When I asked when it would be confirmed, the Hispanic woman told me ""you'll know when you arrive"" and hung up. Following my arrival, I was told the room still wasn't ready even though check-in was less than 45 minutes away and that representative did take my cell number for follow up and never called me. When I returned, the desk reps couldn't find my reservation for 20 minutes despite me already providing my credit card, ID, and bags when I departed the first time. On a positive note, the doorman and housekeeping staff were fantastic. Very helpful, very accommodating, very friendly. The location was great and metro accessible. The décor was okay, much better in the lobby areas than the room itself. Overall, I wouldn't stay here again or recommend this location for others. I will continue using the Hilton brand as this was my first poor experience and is not reflective of all my previous experiences with your organization."
the room and hotel was dirty. everywhere there was dust and mold. when you look at the elevator's door you can see dust falling on you. hilton honors gold cards doesn't work here. the shower was not working and even after fixing the pressure was not enough. the internet was not working after 4 warnings I gave up. the quality of the breakfast was very low. If you are going to rent a room in here. reconsider another one
"We were very happy about the location. The staff was great. We stayed 4 days in December and the street was closed at one part due to Presidential visit, our bell hop made a special trip to find us a cab. The manager worked through as issue we were having with hot water and resolved the problem. Yah! to Phil the Manager!!"
Staff was friendly. Hotel was in a great location. Plenty of restaurants. Easy walk to Time Square. Room was clean. Only drawback was breakfast. Go out to eat. Breakfast in the hotel was too expensive and not very good.
Great neighborhood....close to Grand Central Station and Bryant Park. Room I have stayed in has a balcony and a view of the river. Something you don’t find in many NYC hotels. Staff are great and very helpful. 
"Very friendly staff, nice location. We loved our room. It's not often that you have a room with an actual private balcony in Manhattan, and ours did, and we definitely made good use of it! We definitely will stay here again."
I stay in Hilton hotels all the time but this one was definitely the worst one I ever stayed in. Staff - grumpy and non-attentive Location - good but as the hotel is located on a busy street the room was extremely noisy Décor - the facilities and the room were very outdated
"I chose this place because it used to be the old Tudor City Hotel, which had some character in the day, and is located in a quiet corner of midtown Manhattan. I was curious to see what Hilton did with the hotel. Having stayed there three nights, I'm pretty shocked that Hilton would put its name on the place. The ""room with a street view"" that I asked for was like a dark cave, in the back of the hotel, overlooking an airshaft. A TV blocked the one window that I had. The carpet was damp with cleaning fluid, and the jacuzzi jets in the bathtub were dirty. Everything about the place was about as generic as you could get, from the furniture in my room to the lobby to the lounge area. I was particularly surpised to see a hotel employee sitting at a table set up in the lobby at 11pm at night, in street clothes, in lieu of anybody at the front desk. It looked to be for security purposes, but just served to reinforce the fact that I was staying in what felt like a bad dormitory. All I can say is, doesn't the Hilton chain have any standards? If you do stay here, insist on a street-facing view; better yet, ask for one of their balcony rooms, which would have to be something of an improvement."
"We had a standard queen room for 5 nights. Staff were friendly at check in and we found our room easily. The room was small but that isn’t a problem you only sleep in your room. However it was very warn out the aircon temperature could only be changed by a couple of degrees! The bathroom door didn’t close properly and was damaged, the sink had weird stains in it and as did the toilet. I felt for the price we paid it was a let down! And especially as you add on 3/4 different taxes to the price we got online!Having stayed in doubletree by Hilton in the uk I expected the Hilton here to be better or at least on par but it did fall a little short! Location was really good and we easily walked to all the main attractions incl... Central Park, Times Square, madison Square garden 5th Avenue and Empire State etc!! "
"Hi - On a recent trip to the Hilton Grand Central it was raining and I went to the front desk where Kevin & Christina were both working. They were both very friendly and said all of the hotel umbrellas had already been taken; however, Christina told me I could borrow her personal one since her shift wasn't over for few hours. Wow I thought, how great was that that a member of the team would let me borrow their personal umbrella. Thanks Christina and Kevin, you are both the best!"
"Dirty, internet did not work, no hot water or heat the first night, although thus was a planned outage, no warning. Housekeeping took my diffuser from my personal blow dryer. Awful. Staff did nothing to help. Was told they would give points, have not seen them."
"We stayed three nights in November. The hotel is in a lovely location near the Chrysler building, the East River, and many great restaurants and shopping. The subway stop could be a little closer, but you can hop a cab for a few bucks to get there if you don't want to walk.Our room was huge and very comfortable. The staff here is excellent, friendly, and helpful. My only complaint about the place is that on our second and third night there was a weird, loud crashing noise (not a door) which started at 3:30 am and continued every 45 minutes or so for the rest of the night. I don't know if it was the heating/water pipes, the elevator, or an angry/noisy/drunk guest. Otherwise, things were quiet and peaceful, which is nice in NYC. I'd stay here again, just maybe try to get a very quiet room."
"I gave 3 stars because of the location only , Great location but has nothing to do with Hilton standards , we had the king suite with balcony, no mini bar in the room ,no water no room service.. when we complained to the manager he offers to bottle of water "
"Nice property adjacent to the United Nations. Easy 10-15 minute walk to the Grand Central subway terminal and multiple dining options nearby.My main issue with this property is the awful internet service.I stay at Hilton properties all over the world and this one has the worst internet service to date. I literally have better service at a Hampton Inn in the mountains of rural West Virginia than you will get here.Could not connect to corporate VPN and could barely connect at all.If you are a business traveler like me, look elsewhere.Shame as this is otherwise a solid property."
"Small rooms which are typical of NYC. Older hotel which will require upgrades in a few years. We only use the room to sleep and shower so it was fine for us. Internet not up to par, kept dropping. Some rooms noisy."
"My friend and I stayed at this hotel and were lucky enough to have booked the Queen Suite for our stay. Our rooms were clean, bright and warm. Great bathroom with complimentary shampoos, etc, excellent coffee in the coffee maker and we even had a bit of a view of the East River.The staff we met and needed assistance from were kind, courteous and very helpful, our concierge on our arrival gave us a complimentary drink each from the bar which was a really kind touch - we'd joked with him that neither of our husbands had the foresight to arrange for a bottle of bubbly to be waiting in our suite. We had such a great stay and time in New York City that we are already planning to return Nov 2018 but hoping to stay longer next time.Grand Central Station, 5th Avenue, Times Square and Central Park are all a walk away from this hotel. We did a lot of walking, got very footsore but it was well worth it!"
"I came here on business— meetings at Pfizer USA headquarters. The hotel was clean, quiet, felt small and intimate. The view from the window was a nice touch. All in all it was really nice, with a comfy bed and linens. Nicely done!"
"Within walking distance to Times Square, Madison Square Garden and Rockefeller Center. Also, just a short subway ride to the World Trade area. I recommend staying here but stay away from the breakfast buffet...not worth $29!"
"I was having one night out with friends in the city, I make a reservation in the Hilton Grand Central. It was a very wonderful location, a perfect room , nice , clean, warm in a cool night. Everyone was very pleasant and I enjoyed my stay. I will recommend to anyone!!"
"Located a stones throw from the United Nations and New York's Grand Central Station, this old Dame is beginning to show her age. The rooms are still comfortable but the furniture and fittings are showing distinct signs of wear. Still a reasonable value for money proposition if you are visiting the Big Apple though."
Hotels in New York City are ridiculously expensive and notoriously small rooms but kudos to the staff for upgrading us to a beautiful Terrace suite on the 18th floor with use of the UN in the East River.Great location at Second & 42nd.Probably the best view in New York City with the possible exception of the Millennium Hilton.
"Need lots of improvement in many aspects. The room so dusty, bed sheet had so many stains, clogged shower, heater didn't work properly, amenities supply only provided on the fist day. The staffs not friendly."
"Hotel is nice, centrally located in NYC. The doorman and manager were very helpful however there is not a concierge. There are many things to do in the immediate area. IT is a historical hotel so some comments on HVAC but we did not experience any issues."
"In an historic hotel that's been updated for all the modern amenities, the Hilton Grand Central is a great choice. The rooms are small by recent construction standards, but with doors between you and the elevators and a limited number of rooms per hallway, they are exceptionally quiet. Our had a lovely view of old NYC apartments and the location is convenient to Grand Central Station (as you might guess) as well as a short cab to Times Square and the Theatre District. Not the cheapest choice, but a solid one, with service you can count on."
I stayed here for one night for a quick business meeting. I had work to do in room. WiFi was good to attend telecoms and work on laptop. However there is no room service so I won’t stay here again. I didn’t have time to go out for food.Small rooms.Could get croissant and coffee in morning as left before 7am.
Conveniently located just blocks from the NYC subway and Grand Central Terminal this hotel is well located to get around NYC. The rooms are not large but very nicely appointed with modern furnishings. This was a short trip so I didn't use the dining area or bar. However they did appear quite nice. Would recommend this hotel is you are staying in midtown.
Ok but no soul. Staff seemed distracted from life in general - dusty dirty room with awful view.no food available in form of room service at midnight.Very pricey - albeit good location.Shame as it is a Hilton - but just too much traffic s d poor attention to detail.Pity Hilton.
"This is about as basic of a hotel you will ever find. If you just need a place to sleep every night and you have no desire to spend any more time than absolutely necessary in your room, this place will do the trick. Rooms are tiny and very noisy. Cafe/shop is over priced, the door staff were helpful. "
"This hotel was the Tudor Hotel which was remodeled by Hilton. It has oddly shaped rooms and trying to determine your view using the Hilton App will be impossible. I called and the staff held certain rooms without view obstruction for me. The room was small for the money you pay but then again, it's NYC!The staff was friendly and helpful. The bartender was nice. I liked the old style hotel and had no problems. The hotel is a short walk to Grand Central Station where you can catch the subway to go where ever you like. "
We planned to have a get a way weekend in the city and were looking for a nice hotel for our time but after staying at a Marriott of similar price closer to times square the night before we were disappointed in what we found in Hilton this time around. 
"Our room's internet connection was very unstable and it was very frustrating to be disconnected every few minutes while using our devices. IT support could not do anything to fix other than saying that ""some rooms just don't have very good connection"". Our bathroom plubming would rattle very loudly (from behind the walls) whenver we turned on the shower -- actually, the same thing would happen when other guests were using their water. When we called the front desk, we were told that it's an old building and there was nothing they could do..."
"From the moment we drove up in the taxi the staff was on our team. The bell hop was outside to open the door of the taxi and help us with our bags. The desk staff and housekeeping were always positive and helpful. The room was relatively small but modern with a very comfortable bed, open-able, screened windows with iron, ironing board, hair dryer, free coffee and pot and complementary bottled water. Elevators are prompt and speedy. If any complain, the doors closing at our end of the hall were loud and clunky. The hotel is four blocks from Grand Central Terminal and about the same distance from the East River. There are numerous restaurants within easy walking distance. The theater district is less than a mile away. I would absolutely stay here again."
"Room was clean and the size was reasonable for New York. The location is good : Upper East Midtown, near everything but not too busy. However the wi-fi kept unconnecting, which is intolerable for a hotel at that price."
"We checked early and the room was ready, which was nice. That was the only good thing about this stay. As soon I got into the room I called the front desk and said the room is too shabby, please get me another. It was also WAY smaller than the photos with the reservation. It was supposed to be a Suite. It was just a room with a sofa rather than a second bed. They would not change rooms because :They are sold out"". During the night the shabby sleep sofa collapsed on the family member sleeping in it. They did change to room right away when we complained. This was 9am. Why could they not do that the night before? Anyway, this room was like the room in the photo and not quit as shabby. The problem with this room was there was something with the air vent that caused the sheet metal to bag very loudly about every 40 minutes...ALL NIGHT LONG! It was bad enough to wake you scared to death...every 40 minutes or so..When I asked for a substantial adjust for both nights the manger said he could not because I had prepaid. HORRIBLE. Don't stay here."
"Been staying here for years and just spent a girls’ weekend here. Quietly tucked in a great, safe neighborhood, you can easily grab a cab up it downtown. Ask for a balcony and enjoy a glass of wine while you enjoy the city lights!"
"I stayed here only one night but really enjoyed the limited time I spent in the hotel. The hotel is old, but is also very charming like living in an old NY Apartment. The Hotel has updated the rooms nicely but they still retain the charm of old New York City-- my room had this small tablet device which controlled the air purifier, scent, and even had mood sounds.The only items that the hotel could do better are on perhaps integrating the A/C into the tablet (at least for my room it was separate and on the wall). Also- it is important to note this is a little bit of a walk from Grand Central (3 or so long city blocks) so if you are carrying luggage from there like I did, it does take a bit of effort.I look forward to returning to this hotel again soon!"
"I stayed here a few days after a nightmare Airbnb and the staff was great. Very friendly at all areas of the hotel, particularly the front desk and entrance. I had injured my ankle while at the Nightmare Airbnb, and the staff did little things to to ensure my stay was easier, like giving my grab-and-go food in a bag without me requesting. Close walk to Grand Central station and a great location, very quiet. Only thing I would slight it for is the cups were plastic, but that might just be standard at Hiltons now. I mostly stay at HGIs and Hampton Inns."
"I travel for work/business and leisure a lot. The Hilton Grand central was perhaps the worst experience I have ever had at a hotel, steamboat bad that I probably willl never stay at a Hilton again, inexcusable the have no pillow cases. Gross and no accountability from hotel staff. Shame on HTML n grand Cental"
"Since this is a Hilton, I expected so much better. I know the rooms in New York are small, but we were put in a room with an adjoining door to the room next door, catty-corner. Through the adjoining door we could hear every word that the occupants said( or yelled) at all hours, even when the woman decided to be on the phone between 4:30 and 5 am. There was no fridge or microwave, only 2 plastic cups which were never replaced during ourr 4 day stay. There was mold on the shower curtain and the vents in the room and bath were disgustingly filthy. The bathroom door had to be shoved to close properly. Every outlet was hanging by a screw and mostly off the waall. In fact, my husband plugged in his phone and it sparked and burned the outlet cover! The ac refused to go up or down even when we stood and repeatedly clicked it. It was NOT a good experience!"
"Mold issue in bathroom, clogged toilet, and no laundry was brought after requested! Very disappointed with my experience especially it being the first time in New York City! Wish the hotel would have discounted at least one night to make up for their issues! Not worth price!!"
Stayed for three nights. Was an unpleasant stay from beginning to end. Rude staff to begin my stay in a dismal dark room. The next morning I was awoken by construction (that I was not told about) across the hall. There is a place for breakfast where I went for a very overpriced buffet where in the end I only could eat oatmeal and fruit as the hot selections were inedible. A terrible example of a Hilton. Will never stay there again.
"Girlfriends trip to Bew York took a turn for the worse when the air broke at our hotel. The smell in the bathroom if a moldy shower curtain was overwhelming. The bathroom fan was broken as well. There was an air purifier, but it didn’t work either. "
Great location just off busy main roads. Nice room though I had to remove the bulbs from the bedside lights to sleep because they kept pulsing light long after you turned them off!! The balcony had a good view to the river and the bed was comfy.The lack of bar and restaurant I found very odd for what should have been a grander hotel. It just has a weird 'market' cafe thing which was pretty disappointing.
"Did not happen in Hilton Grand Central. Usually you can trust on a certain level when you choose a Hilton as accommodation. Here the expectations were not met at all. Having a long weekend getaway and getting disappointed. Even Hilton Diamond member, get's this treatment, wonder what it would be without one card. The semi-ok part was a complimentary breakfast. Location good in mid Manhattan. Old hotel building sets some limits of freshness, I guess..."
The hotel live up to the Hilton Brand. The staff extremely courteous and the Bell Men most helpful. The location to attractions and eateries were great. We would not hestitate to stay there again when we visit NYC
"This hotel was good. It was so old though. The shower was like a science experiment to try and figure out. The room were tiny but okay. I was pleased to see that there as an air purifier in the room, but that happiness quickly turned to annoyance when the iPad used to run it made it explicitly clear there was an additional charge to run it beyond 30 mins. I am sensitive to air when I travel and being that this hotel was old, I thought it was a great gesture to clean up the funky air, but instead I had to pay so that was a huge bummer. This hotel also isn’t located near anything notable so unless you have no other options for hotels, stay somewhere a few blocks closer if the cost is the same. In the summer, you can walk to grand central, Rockefeller center and nicer restaurants but in the winter, it would be a hike up long Manhattan blocks."
Great location and very friendly staff. Beds are very comfortable. The old carpet needs to be removed. Wifi was not the fastest or most reliable. I do recommend this hotel because of the fabulous location and extremely helpful and friendly staff!
"I had some issues initially with the quality of my room. The shower/tub was very old and clogged. As well, the toilets flushed very slowly and the water pressure was not adequate. In addition to the water pressure being an issue, the water took almost 10 minutes to get hot in the sink as well as the toilet. furthermore, the room had an unpleasant odor in it as it seemed to be reminiscent of an older hotel. I complained to the manager on duty and she did change my room and i was very pleased. However, i feel that i should have not had this type of accommodations at a Hilton hotel. very surprised and displeased."
"Had a wedding at the park in Tudor City and stayed at the Grand Central Hilton Hotel which was just 1/2 block away. Lovely hotel, good service and convienent for the ceremony, reception was directly cross down so easy to just take the M42 bus.."
"Except for the wonderful bell staff service and one positive front desk employee, we were so very disappointed in our stay at this hotel. We found garbage in the bathroom trash can upon check-in and were offered an upgraded room. Our suite had seen better days ... long ago. Outlets and lights did not work, the TV technology is so old that audio fades in and out, HVAC vents were extremely dirty, wallpaper was peeling, sofa saggy and old. Disappointing all around!"
one more night but with those experience we had to look another hotel. When I call for reservation I mentioned we have show at 49 street on Broadway. I did ask closest possible. They lie to us. They said hotel was 42 nd street close to Broadway. It was almost by FDR. Very disappointed.
"Nice location, fine old building and a helpful staff. Smallish room but a nice bathroom, two windows in this 'corner' at 1312. I think one window overlooks 41st Street and some older buildings noted as Tudor City, some original skyscrapers. That would explain the European sized hotel room. But it's very clean, just a couple of blocks from Grand Central Station and the UN, plus had several good Japanese restaurants nearby. "
"everything you can think of this hotel did not deliver. staff, at least the ones I encountered were awful. the room was filled with dust and broken furniture etc. as if it wasn't even cleaned. staying one night and didn't even want to complain as we spend most of the time outside. was praying that the beddings were cleaned or changed.... "
old and out dated valet took forever. they updated like a band aid over a bad wound .thats all i have to say but i have to write 200 letters to compleat this servey . i hate writing more than i have to so this is what I have to do sorry
Historic property from the 1930s and very conveniently located. However.....My room literally faced a wall and was dark and gloomy. I had to downgrade myself just so I wouldn’t be facing a wall. Staff at the hotel were indifferent to downright rude. I complained to the duty manager about a member of staff in the cafe’ who was extremely rude to me. He just wasn’t interested in hearing and didn’t even budge from his seat to address the matter. Very disappointed with the service in general. I’d stay at this property again only if there are no rooms available anywhere in NYC. 
"Booked blind through hotwire.com, received the Hilton. It calls itself the ""Grand Central,"" but it's a couple of blocks away from the Station. Nevertheless, an excellent hotel with an art deco vibe. Room was larger than I expected, with windows overlooking 42nd Street. Bed was soft but firm.The bathroom was spacious. Another reviewer complained about the shower requiring instructions----I had no problem using and appreciated the dial used to set the approximate water temperature. Plus, the tub was the largest I've ever seen in *any* hotel. Perfect for a nice hot bath.Nearby on 3rd Avenue is Sarge's Deli; ordered a onion and cheese omelet that was larger than a human head---delicious, but too much for one person."
"If you're looking for old New York - this is the place for you. A three short block walk will get you to the Big Bus Tour stop at the United Nations and you can take their bus to Times Square and go anywhere from there. The hotel is well kept but expect the rooms to be small. We were well pleased and will stay there going forward. The Waldorf Astoria had always been our home away from home in NYC - and there certainly is no comparison, but we were satisfied with the suite on the 20th floor. Great restaurant right across the street. CVS - with sandwiches and food - right up the street."
"This is a great location to midtown activities, and the hotel is clean and well-run. My wife and I were very happy with the accommodations and service.I would recommend to anyone, especially couples."
"I had the worst experience staying at Hilton during my trip to NYC. There was a lady, who claims herself to be a manager and her name is ""Shadae"". She was beyond RUDE and when we told her that she was rude, she clearly knew it and said: ""Yes I know, I apologize.""Here is what happened. We came back at midnight, she was sitting in front of the computer in the lobby. We asked if she could give us bottled water, she said ""No, we don't provide water in this hotel. There is a 24 hours deli outside the hotel, you can get some there."" Then we asked how come other staff gave us water earlier. When she heard this, she changed her answer ""We are out of water. There is no water in this hotel."" We wanted to talk to the manager, she said she was the manager. Then we said "" Miss, do you know you are rude?"" She answered ""Yes. I apologize."" Then left us alone. I am very DISAPPOINTED at HILTON GRAND CENTRAL! This is definitely not the customer service I was expecting to get from Hilton!! I won't stay at this hotel again because of Shadae!!! I spent over $1,000 for my stay and definitely won't do it again!"
I have stayed in this hotel many times and enjoy the proximity to Grand Central Station. It has a neighborhood feel and is quiet compared to other hotels along Lexington. You do not have to wait for the elevators and the staff is very accommodating.
"I don't care for hotel chains that much, but this Hilton has character. I know, how difficult it is to get a good room in NYC, so I know my room was a gem. Private terrace with great views, also great view from every single window of the room. The room itself was spacious for NYC and cosy in many ways. Those of you who want a restaurant on spot this might be disappointing, because this Hilton does not have a restaurant on spot, but it does have a lounge bar serving food as well (closing 10.30 pm), but I don't consider this a problem. I mean, it's New York - you get food all night long anyway. But you might not get the view. The service is super friendly. As I said I prefer avoiding chains, but this is a Hilton I love. I will be back. Location also good. (Sure I know, if you want the view, you need to get room from upper floors - I don't know, if these rooms are more expensive, but it's worth it)"
"Quick business trip to Manhattan. This hotel is very well placed, just down the road from Grand Central Station, so a lot of the city is walkable.As usual with Manhattan hotel rooms, mine was fairly small. It was just for sleeping soon didn't need a lot of space and it was ok for what I needed. There were a couple of issues though, which I would put down to a basic lack of maintenance. The basin plug didn't work, which is a bit of an issue when you need to shave, one of the outlets on the desk lamp didn't work, which isn't great when you need to work and the coffee maker didn't work. When you spend over $500 for one night, none of these issues should arise, or maybe I was unlucky that one of them happened just on the day I was staying. But it should be one issue, not three.I mentioned these at check out and received an apology plus some Hilton Honors points. I was in 813 and I hope that the management make the necessary fixes before someone else stays in that room."
"Great hotel, convenient location. We had a suite on the top floor, it was very spacious, had a bedroom and separate sitting area. Would definitely stay here again. Walking distance to Grand Central, the Chrysler building, Rockefeller center, 5th Ave, and Times Square."
"Couldn't have been more disappointed with this Hilton.Got there about 10, expecting the bar and restaruant to be open. (this IS New York city which is open 24 hours a day) But it was closed. Not acceptable.Very long check in line with only one clerkNo place to park the cab, so the cabbie let me out in the middle of traffic.Reservations said they were within WALKING DISTANCE from the Amtrack Station. That is 2 miles away. I call walking distance a few blocks when you have 2 suitcases.Rooms very small, with no upgrades for Diamond Members.Poor experience."
Great service! The staff went above and beyond by making us comfortable and giving us helpful times with discovering New York City. All beds were replaced with new ones during our stay so it was lovely to see that they update the hotel to keep it comfortable and modern. Excellent location. 
"Thank you for making us feel at home once again. We love the friendly staff and the very clean accommodations. The Front Desk staff are definitely top notch with everything they do, from the efficient check in process, answering questions, and the speedy check out service. Nina was especially polite and very professional as we needed to extend our stay due to Hurricane Irma. The restaurant and all the servers are very polite and the food is delicious.Last but not least, Jeff the General Manager is remarkable and his hotel & staff are outstanding.We will definitely be back.Thank you Hilton New York Grand Central for all your wonderful hospitality.Sincerely,Your friends from Florida, Helen & Scott"
A regular here at this property for many years since the Reno in 2010 about 6-8 times per year.Generally book a large king or mini suite as the rooms are on the smaller side as a boutique hotel.Very nice little bar with very attentive and friendly bartender and a nice quiet breakfast only restaurant.Front door man and desk well attended and efficient to your requests. A knowledgeable concierge as well as a theatre desk booking.Front desk team always accommodating I enjoy returning here and a convenient location if you are touring.Well done and will continue to return
"This accommodation was very relaxing and pleasing. The staff made my stay welcoming, showing politeness and comforting. I definitely will recommend the business to everyone that ask about a good place to go. "
"Like many Hilton's these days this hotel is nothing extraordinary. It is clean, with a modern lobby area that allows for working or grabbing a cup of coffee, with plugs and and different table options. This hotel is right near Grand Central, but one block off the busiest parts, giving it a bit of a quieter feel. While not sparking and bright, as you see in the pictures, the hotel is pleasantly decorated with Paris themes. Room was a bit dark, and fell just short of looking really nice, but it was functional and clean enough. Unusually, this narrow hotel has six elevators, a real bonus in NYC. No long waits. Staff were all very kind. Internet was sometimes fast, but at times doggedly slow. Forget watching Netflix when this happens. Breakfast was decent. The mens room in the lobby was disgusting. While I try to avoid Hiltons anyway (their other brands such as HGI and Hampton are far better), I do wish that Hilton would take more pride in their flagship brand. With a little more attention, some of these hotels could be terrific."
"Stayed there for UNGA week so much hustle and bustle on the streets. But hotel is superbly located for UN business and the staff super helpful and efficient. Nice breakfast restaurant and a small lobby adapted to work and meetings. As most hotels in NY, rooms are small. But they were clean and pleasant. Would definitely return. "
"Due to hurricane Irma, our flight through Miami was cancelled and we had to stay another night in New York. Our original hotel, the New York Hilton Midtown, was sold out for the night, so we had to choose a hotel on the go. We were lucky to get a room at this hotel, as Manhattan hotels were totally booked. The hotel is just a block away from the UN HQ, in a very quiet part of midtown Manhattan. The hotel is small and quaint, in one of the buildings that gives this part of town the name Tudor City. The room was on the 6th floor, quite small and with a decent bathroom. The AC was pretty loud and the hotel would benefit from a makeover, but it is good enough, within walking distance of major attractions. It is a quiet hotel, with no frills, but good service and easy check-in and check-out. My wife preferred this hotel to our original one and said she would not mind returning."
"Although named ""Grand Central"" this is far enough away from the heavy congested midtown rush to feel as though you have a bit of a respite from the crowds. Check in was mostly smooth. Room wasn't ready ( I was early) but they did contact me immediately via phone when it was ready. No acknowledgment of my diamond status at check in. But this lack of acknowledgment has become such the norm at Hiltons that I'm not sure why I expect it anymore. I did not receive any of the usual amenities offered to diamond members nor did I receive an explanation of the hotel's amenities. Lobby is smallish but nice. My room had a separate living area which was great to have space to entertain. Rooms were shockingly quiet for NYC. Although the hotel has clearly been updated, a few nice touches remain that give the hotel a bit of an antique feel. Bathrooms not as modern as some hotels. Bed was comfortable. Room was clean. The gym was smallish. I was excited about having an onsite sauna but unfortunately it was broken. Unfortunately this hotel does not have a full service restaurant or bar, just a take away for mostly snacks. Restaurants and coffee shops are plentiful nearby so not too horrible. The breakfast buffet was subpar although the service was super friendly and efficient. All in all, I'd add this to my list of Manhattan hotels which I find pleasant."
No frills hotel - don't expect any food options here. Age is apparent as room amenities are a bit run down and bathroom is dated. The hotel is close to the UN so beware during times that the UN is in session. 
This hotel is in a good location ONLY if you need to be close to the UN.. The air conditioning needs work - the rooms always feel wet and humid. The quality of the bathrooms need work as there were several issues with my room.
The rooms were quite nice and spacious throughout. Also in a very good location along the main road through NYC. Easy walking distance to stores and local restaurants. Would have liked to have seen more options food and restaurant wise in the hotel however.
"Bathroom was filthy, there is no restaurant although hotel site says there is, staff is uncaring. Absolutely not a good place for the money. I stayed at another hotel, not a chain and cheaper place in the neighborhood that was so much better. I was under impression I was upgrading going to Hilton but it felt like I stayed at Motel 6."
"I stayed at the Hilton Grand Central in Manhattan NY for two nights last week. My room was very nice, clean and comfortable with very good internet conection. I was on the 17th floor of the tower near the front of the hotel. From here I got a good view of the surrounding area. The location of teh hotel was very good as it gave easy access to the Grand Central Station, the UN, Times Square, Broadway etc. Hotel amenities were good. I have stayed in this hotel several times, but this was the first time I stayed in a room without a writing table and chair. So if you need a table and chair to do some catching up with work, be careful when choosing your room!"
"I was in NYC for an overnight for business. This hotel was booked for me at a corporate rate that was very reasonable. The street entrance is very ""boutique"" hotel looking which is nice and welcoming. Lobby was clean and attractive and check in was very fast and easy. The room was small but nice, same with the bathroom. Everything was as expected HOWEVER...when I went to take a shower...there was no hot water, wifi was not working, and the vent in the ceiling began clanging at 5am. I reported all to the front desk attendant the next morning of checkout and they handled it very well. They apologized and offered me a generous amount of Hilton Reward Points. I wish there was a ""GOOD"" rating because it would be more accurate. The Hilton Grand Central was better than ""average"" but not quite ""very good"" status. To be fair however the staff handled the negative with grace and generosity. As mentioned the location was very good if you want to be in and out to get easier access to the main drag to get to the airport and want to be a little further removed from tourist areas. Not a ton around but I had a great walk (just down 42nd St) that took me right past Grand Central and in to Times Square in about 20 minutes. The area seemed safe and I had no sketchy incidents at all. Cafe inside is small but well appointed, more like a upper scale convenience store than cafe, but there is a small bar to grab a cocktail and something quick and made. I did come back late after the close and the front desk showed me to an all night deli just across the street and it was fine. Positive note...there were NO cabs the night I had to be out. The bellmen worked very hard, standing the intersection, whistling and hustling to find me a ride. It took a while but they were successful! I would give it another shot. It was a safe and clean place to spend the night."
The lobby floor of this historic hotel looks like a shabby bus terminal. This is a Hilton Hotel? I stay in a lot of Hiltons around the country and in NYC. This should not be a Hilton. Room small but ok. No glasses in the room; just one plastic cup.
Hotel is very close to Subway or Grand central. Rooms were great and reminded me of old style charm. We even had a balcony! This is NYC after all-so expect smallish rooms for the price. Some small cosmetic details need to be fixed here and there. But we didn't come to stay all day in a hotel room but rather enjoy what the city has to offer. Will definitely come again.
"New York ! New York , a place you love or a trap you detest . Nothing in between . We stayed here for 6 nights . There was no laundry area . Breakfast was very expensive at $35 per / pax , even their employee dissuaded us from eating there . Room was small but clean . The Porter arranged a cab ride to te JFK International airport for $90 , but we were charged $155. Were the cab driver and Porter / doorman (his name was Tony) in connivance ? We felt cheated and duped."
"It is a old hotel. This hotel is just old. However, I got many surprises. When I first went to our bed, I found a dirty spot on the sheet. Nothing to compliant. My wife only needs a Tea Kettle. I called three times from the time I checked in till night. Every time they told me, ""I will call you back immediately"", ""I will send it to you immediately"". Were we playing hide and seek? I admit I lose. But this is still not the climax part. So then I went showering. In the middle of showering, water suddenly went cold. Seriously? I almost caught cold. I called them again. They told me something broke. Surprise!"
"I arrived at the hotel to learn the room type I reserved was overbooked. I never received a call prior to my arrival to indicate what happened. While it was very frustrating to not have received a call informing me of this, the front desk attendant (Christina, I believe was her name) was very hospitable and worked to address my inconvenience. I appreciated her working to make my stay at the hotel enjoyable. Overall, the location of the hotel was great, and the service of the staff in attendance was excellent."
"I'll start with some positives: clean, decent bed, couldn't hear other guests in the hotel.But if you're at all sensitive to noises while you sleep, this is not the hotel for you.I don't usually consider myself a light sleeper, but the incessant noises in this hotel made it impossible for me and my husband to get a good night's rest. Their air conditioning unit is extremely outdated and so, every 20 minutes or so, expect a loud clang in your room just over your bed.After night one of this, my husband and I asked for a new room, hoping this issue was unique to our room could be easily solved by moving. The front desk told us to pack our belongings and they'd move us to a new room while we were out exploring. When we returned to the hotel that evening, a different person at the front desk politely told us they had no idea what we were talking about and no, we couldn't get a new room. They then sent a maintenance guy up to our room to explain to us that the banging was just part of how the air conditioning units functioned, that the sound happened in every room, and he hoped someday the hotel would renovate in order to fix the issue. For now, our best bet was to turn the unit to a higher temperature (in the summer!) so the noise came less frequently. Great. It worked all right, until about halfway through night two when an incessant banging could be heard in the room below us, likely attributed to (yes, you guessed it!) their air conditioning unit! Other little things: - There's no in-room mini fridge to keep drinks cold so you have to do it the old fashioned way using an ice machine. - The market downstairs, where you can buy snacks or sit down to a meal, is expensive. It's $28 per person for the buffet or you can buy an $8 breakfast sandwich (that isn't good) and wash it down with a $5 water. - The mirrors in the lobby seemed like they had rusted over, so the presentation there was lacking. I don't know why this bugged me so much, but it did. (See photos.)All in all, you can find better hotels elsewhere. Save yourself the pain of an unrestful, warm night listening to the a/c unit banging and the toilet running all night by going somewhere else."
This hotel is 3 blocks from Grand central and very close to the UN. The rooms are a bit old but have been refurbished. The rooms in the higher floors nice bu the internet is spotty. some of the rooms have a partial view of the east river. Nice place to stay for a good price.
"Yes, it's an older hotel. Elevators were fast so that was helpful. Room was small but not unexpected for NYC. Noise from ac was awful and woke me up every 2 hours. After complaining, maintenance told me ""it's old"" and there was nothing they could do. Breakfast buffet was VERY expensive and only fare. Overall staff was nice. I expected an executive lounge or at least complimentary coffee in the lobby available before 7am. There was neither which was most disappointing of all. Probably will not stay here again. "
"Love this hotel. I come every year to the US Open tennis tournament and I've been choosing this hotel for at least the past 13 years. It's perfectly located, very clean, reasonably priced (often very reasonably priced). Two blocks from Grand Central and just a few blocks more to Times Square. I would not consider any other hotel."
"Very good location just several blocks from Grand Central Station. Friendly & helpful staff with very convenient services like comfortable lobby/eating area with tables, TV & computer printers. Lots of shopping, restaurants & theatre nearby. "
"I booked this room on the Hilton Honors site for a quick NYC getaway, traveled with my wife and son. We loved the location and the staff were excellent! The lobby is also nicely renovated.Unfortunately the room itself is in dire need of updating... We were in a 1bdrm suite that had:- Paint that was bubbling and on the verge of peeling- HVAC unit that made a very LOUD bang noise in the ceiling every 20 mins or so. We had to turn off the unit, lucky it wasn't too hot/cold so we were ok.- Wireless internet that was spotty at best- Very big crack on the bathroom countertop- Paint that was bubbling and on the verge of peeling- Bed was uncomfortable, seems like mattress/springs were worn, not to Hilton standards- Sofa bed my son slept on was lumpy and uncomfortable as wellWe didn't request to change rooms as the I think the conditions are across all rooms in the hotel. I mentioned these items when checking out and Kevin was very nice about it, I made it clear that it's not the staff's fault, it's more that the hotel needs updating. Seems a bit unfortunate, I always attributed the Hilton name to more upscale and nicer locations and this one just didn't fit the bill. The price, however, was still Hilton prices."
Location is great. Junior suite spacious enough. High floors good and well served by elevators. Staff totally indifferent and poorly trained in service skill seemingly. Would hope for much better from a well placed Manhattan Hilton. Rooms old and not renovated for a long time. Breakfast super expensive and not extensive. SHame overall as this hotel is in a good location but will not be returning here at all. 
"I was visiting for a quick business trip - came in at 10 pm and checked out the following morning. I cannot comment on the amenities of the hotel, but I can comment on the room. First, the room was in a little hallway behind a door with one other room. It made me feel uncomfortable to be secluded in a very small hallway behind a door. The room was super small with large furniture. The bathroom was spacious, but the shower was the most difficult shower I've ever had to figure out - took me 5 minutes to turn it on only to realize once I was showering that there were instructions above the shower head! (Note - if your shower needs explicit instructions, you probably need a different shower.) I also could not get the room to a comfortable temperature with the air conditioner. The only pro was that the bed was comfortable."
We stayed at the Hilton Manhattan grand central location three weeks ago and the experience was wonderful. My wife mistakenly booked a single bed by mistake but the front desk attendant was extremely helpful. Kevin was able to get a double bed room without any issue. It turned what could've been a disaster into an excellent weekend. Thank you
I spent 3 days here August 17 to 20th for my honeymoon. Kevin at the front desk was wonderful and he and his boss upgraded us from a standard room to a Jr suite! The hotel is in a great location for seeing the city. The rooms were clean and well cared for even though it is an older hotel. Thank you for helping us to have a truly special honeymoon.
"Traveling for two days with family. Fantastic location - about 5 minute walk from Grand Central and UN Headquarters, and 15 minutes walk from Times Square and Broadway. Person at check-in in the evening was quite inflexible. However, breakfast was good (continental spread, plenty of hot food, fresh fruit) and staff were courteous. Kevin at the front desk was fantastic and helpful. They provided a pack-and-play for my daughter to sleep in. Rooms a bit old, tub drain was broken...but overall spacious. Mattress was firm and good. I would stay here again."
"I stay at the Hilton Grand Central often and while the location of the hotel is great, the front desk team is totally AWESOME. Kevin in particular always does a great job to make me and the other guests feel welcomed when we arrive. The team always does their best to find their guests the best possible room. I highly recommend."
Stayed here for a week during a business trip. Was very comfortable and the staff was friendly and helpful. Rooms are small but normal for New York City. Great location with really good eateries near by. Doormen were really friendly and helpful with baggage and calling cabs. Overall a great stay!
"Normally stay at the Hilton Midtown, this time tried something a bit different. Great hotel. Felt more like Europe than NYC. Charming, 1940's feel - expected to see Cagney or Bogart in the lobby. Had east river view toward the UN. Great room. Incredible shower power even on 20th floor!"
"Room was clean. Staff was nice. However, to have to pay for WiFi in NYC!? Crazy! Restaurants, Cars and buses are now equipped with free WiFi, but you have to pay for it in NYC at a well known franchise. Way to nickel and dime your patrons."
"I have sampled widely from the Hilton family of hotels, holding Diamond status for most of the last decade and more. By far, The Hilton Grand Central is the most disappointing accommodation I have ever experienced at a Hilton family hotel. I found my room to be unpleasant and the hotel to lack any redeeming qualities other than its location."
I stayed in the Hilton NY Grand Central hotel expecting tiny rooms and noise. I got neither. My room on the 5 the floor was a very good size with a King Size bed and 60inch tv. The room was clean and very quiet with a decent shower. I heard no traffic noises. The staff at breakfast provides amazing service. The location is great and is only a short Uber ride from most attractions. I enjoyed my stay here. 
My mum and I returned to this hotel for the 5th time this earlier this month and our latest visit was as good if not better than all the previous times. One of the positives about this hotel is the location. Situated right near Grand Central Station it is in walking distance to a wide range of amenities that New York has to offer. Rooms are clean and comfy however the best thing about this hotel has to be it's staff. Nothing is ever too much trouble and they are always friendly and courteous. This hotel really is like home from home and made my birthday trip to New York rememberable. Already booked my return trip next year and can not wait. A real gem of a hotel. 
"Upon check in I asked for a nicer room as I was staying for 12 nights. I was rewarded with a room who's headboard shared a wall with the elevator shafts and another wall with the housekeeping storeroom. Didn't switch as I had to drop my bags and head off to work. Temperature was very cold in the room, which I liked. dIdn't have to mess with thermostat at all during my stay.As I was working nights I asked for later housekeeping service. I didn't have much luck. Seems the housekeeping staff leaves early (odd for a Hilton branded hotel). I had to interrupt my sleep on days I wanted service. Housekeeping staff, themselves, were very pleasant and did their jobs well.Bathrooms very outdated. Needed to be an arm wrestler to turn the shower on. Trim is cracked and patched and just in need of a major overhaul. Big old iron burn in the middle of my carpet.Breakfast buffet was priced far too high. I'd expect to pay $30+ for a Sunday brunch, not a standard breakfast. Good spread but not max dollar spread.Hotel is very conveniently located. Plenty of dining options, a few supermarkets, and close to transportation."
"The former Tudor hotel is now Grand Central Hilton. It is the closest hotel to GCT which was convenient for us. Because it is an older building, the rooms are quite large and well appointed. Since we are Gold status, we got upgraded to a Jr. Suite which was very nice. It had an old style jacuzzi and a bidet which we could not figure out how to use but not the hotel's fault."
Celebration weekend. This trip was in celebration of my daughter's 21st birthday. I wanted to bring her to my favorite city and celebrate her coming into adulthood. I booked this hotel because it was close to Grand Central and Times Square. We walked everywhere and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. I paid $50 extra for a balcony and am glad that I did. It made the stay even better. We switched to a different hotel for the second day and it had an even better view. Overall the Hilton Grand Central was really good. Just what I wanted.
"Our Gourmet Club decided to meet at 3 star Michelin restaurant nearby. Selected as per Hilton location at Manhattan for our party of four. Clean room, good beds. Quite small rooms compared to Hilton standards but given to historic tradition of the building quite understandable. Ice machine only in selected floors and the closest at 8th floor was out-of-order."
"This is a beautiful historic hotel in Midtown Manhattan. The lobby has been comfortably redone. Although the rooms have been upgraded, vestiges of outdated amenities remain. There is a goofy red button that you have to push to get hot water in the shower. It either didn't work, or took way too long to get hot water. There was a mysterious BOOM from the HVAC system at irregular intervals. It was loud enough to wake me. Probably difficult to troubleshoot, but the staff didn't communicate with me about it after I complained. Overall, mediocre experience."
"This is a great hotel with an excellent location! I arrived at 9:00 a.m., absolutely exhausted. Kevin L. worked with me to find an available room so that I could check in early, and get some sleep since I'd been up since 3:00 a.m. I've never had a hotel let me check in 7 hours early!! The people who work here is just one reason I'll return to this hotel! It's very clean, the breakfast is great, and it's right by Grand Central Station! You're right where you'd need to be to catch a train/subway to anywhere in the city! I used to stay at the Waldorf Astoria, before it closed. I hadn't found a Hilton since then that I really liked a lot. I found it now!! Thanks again, Kevin! You rule!!!"
"I've been here for 4 nights and thought I'd take a minute to review the Hilton Grand Central. I travel to NY every week for work and stay at Hiltons. The hotel is OK but not on par with other Hilton or Curio hotels in the area. Pros and Cons;Pros:Size of room is better than average. I booked a Jr Suite and it was nice. As a Diamond member, I would have expected to be upgraded, but the room was nice. Value for money - Jr Suite was no more expensive than standard room at other Hilton properties.Light switches - this may seem odd, but you can control all the lights in the room from your bedside. There are 8 different lights in my room and you can turn all lights on, all off or specific lights on/off. This is a nice touch and once I figured out how to work the lights, found it very beneficial. Bed and pillows - very comfortable. Cons:Wifi - As a diamond member I'm allowed to use the premium service for free and it was very slow. I tried to work every evening and found the service sporadic. Much worst than other Hilton hotels in midtown.TV is tiny, especially in a larger room it feels soooo small. Plus many channels frozen (maybe problems with satellite service?). Literally every night AMC was frozen on the same image. I resorted to watching HBO/Netflix on my tablet.Pipes - periodically the bathroom toilet would ""refill"" and large pipe sounds would resonate from the bathroom. Plastic/paper cups - I'd was a bit incredulous that the cups were all plastic and paper. I'd think in the age of environmentally conscious companies the Hilton would use glass cups and ceramic coffee mugs. Breakfast - starts at 7 AM. Really? Most people are out of the hotel by 7. At a minimum breakfast should start at 6:30 and preferably 6:00 AM. Every other Hilton property I've stayed at breakfast starts at the latest 6:30. I had complimentary breakfast and never used it. No Executive lounge - If you are a Diamond member, most Hilton's have an Executive lounge, but no lounge in this hotel.I had 4 weeks reserved here and now I've changed my reservations to go back to another Hilton property hence the 3-star rating."
We spent three nights at this midtown hotel in New York. Room not overly large but clean and comfortable. Value for Money and good access to theatre land about 1/2 an hour walk from Time Square. Staff friendly and ready to assist with any enquiry
"Great location - not a huge hotel, but a full-service Hilton and conveniently located to all areas of the city. Like being a few blocks away from the over-crowded theater district. Like the fact that it's intimate."
Very quaint hotel close to Grand Central Station. If you can get one of the terrace rooms facing the East River you'll enjoy your coffee in the morning even more!We stayed here 4 years ago in January and then again following a Yankee game this summer. Easy walk to the subway/train at Grand Central. Also close to the Morgan Museum which has some interesting collections.
"I stayed here for a business trip. The staff here is very accommodating and friendly. I enjoyed a couple drinks at the little bar where the bartender was very engaging and I met some other nice people in town for business, pleasure and some local people as well. I also found out that this hotel is open for law enforcement to come in and use the lobby bathrooms. A win-win as having that presence around gave an extra layer of safe feeling."
"This is a convenient enough hotel and within easy walking distance of Grand Central and many other tourist spots. It is a little lacking in atmosphere and has a sort of canteen instead of a bar. The room itself was spacious however the acoustics were dreadful. On night one I was woken up by a crying baby next door, night two was a French man talking on his mobile phone at 5.15am, night three was the hairdryer next door and night four was the television next door - a little bit of soundproofing would not go amiss. Also, it was a little chilly one night so we asked for a blanket but were told that there were none left in the hotel so we were out of luck."
"the hotel is situated close to the Grand central terminal, close to all the tourist attractions but quite enough to relax.The hotel is well kept and lovely and clean, it has all you require for a weekend break. the only watch out is breakfast is very expensive eat out."
"Quiet, small in comparison, not a big hotel feel but also doesn't have the facilities of a bigger hotel. I like it for the quiet and small, almost family, hotel feel and so select it every time I am in NY, but if you are looking for a pool, big gym and big hotel atmosphere you won't find it ideal. "
We chose this hotel due to the great reviews. I can say that we picked the right place. Clean rooms/great AC/Excellent Wifi/comfortable beds/Quiet.The proximity to Grand Central station was good as we used the subway system a bunch of times and the walk from there was easy. Staff was was very good to deal with. 
"The room had several faults that were not fixed after having informed personnel. The breakfast buffet is insanely expensive, 31 dollars per person!!!The fitness room was just 5 cardio machines and a few dumbbells. Would not recommend to anyone."
"Stayed for two nights in August. The bed was very comfortable, the room was clean, the bathroom was large. The service was outstanding.And it is in midtown Manhattan, just a few blocks from Fifth Avenue!"
"This is an traditional hotel in Midtown. I believe the building is a landmark building. It is an older hotel, styled like many hotels of same generation that I've visited in Europe. For example, some rooms have accompaniments like bidets, the showers/baths have temperature regulators, and the rooms are not huge; however, the room size is pretty standard for NYC and most major cities in the US and Europe, and the other fixtures are standard in the rest of the world. While I've seen comments online from some complaining about the features I listed, I have no issue. I've noticed many repeat visitors stay for business in the area. It is convenient to the UN, many major businesses of different industries, and hospitals in the area. It is also convenient to many tourist locations and many fabulous restaurants, while having that neighbourhood feel that this part of the city has to offer. All that said, The exceptional staff makes this hotel home to those that travel. It is literally like a second home. The staff always remember repeat visitors, remember your preferences, and always have a smile and ""welcome back"" upon arrival. From all the bellman at the door with smiles and a hello, and assistance with baggage (even pleasantries for my driver); to Kevin, Christina, and Jamie at the front desk with smiles and keys to a room in my favorite tower ready; to Nicoli at the bar for a glass of wine and conversation; and Isa for a perfect coffee in the morning, the staff make travel in Manhattan effortless! I wouldn't imagine staying anywhere else. "
Guest rooms are outdated and show their age - the carpet is worn and bathroom fixtures are old as evidenced by their cracks and wear. I would not recommend this location when there are so many other refreshed options available in New York City.
I would come back again on my next trip I found the staff accommodating and cordial. they couldn't do enough for me during my stay. Its a great location right near the subway and the United Nations easy access to downtown.
We had a Queen room with terrace on the 16th floor. Our room had three windows (including one in the bathroom) plus the glass door to the terrace. Lots of light and a nice view of the Hudson River. Would definitely ask for this room again when staying near Grand Central Terminal.
"I have stayed in Hilton Hotels all over the country, and I usually have great service and enjoy the restaurant and lounge. This is probably the worst Hilton I have ever been in and for the money, I expect quality. The room was nice but old. Window barely open, heater in bathroom was constantly on in July and covered in dust. There are a lot of options in NYC, I will choose a different one next time!"
"This is my second time to stay at this property. Last time was about 3-4 years ago. The positive is the people working at the hotel are very friendly. I checked in as a diamond member and was given an upgrade without asking and 2 waters. Everyone at the front desk was very friendly. I went to my room and the room was clean and I just love the older styles from like the 1920's compared to the new rooms of most of the Hilton hotels in NYC. Went to breakfast and what a disaster. They only have a small buffet with very few choices, cannot even get a hard boiled egg. Honestly it has less choices than a Hampton or even a Holiday Inn Express. I asked to speak with the GM about this but to no avail as the GM had not been on the property for at least 2 days. In the middle of a business week in NYC. Seems to me Hilton has gotten very cheap and is only concern with making more money with less service and benefits for its loyal customers. Great play to stay if a non Hilton Honors member, but go somewhere else to eat as very overpriced and almost no choices of food."
"My second time in this hotel.Due to staying at a Hilton every time, I am also a Hilton Diamond member :)ROOM - They don't give you upgrades unless you ask for it. Being a Diamond member, this is pretty disappointing... LOCATION - The best thing about this hotel. Location and Price.AMENITIES - Average Hilton amenities. (Facial Soap, Bath Soap, Shampoo, Conditioner, Body Cream)RESTAURANT - Breakfast is one of the worst I've had ever. Don't except anything good. I didn't eat there a single time on my 2nd stay (even though its complimentary for diamond members)EXECUTIVE LOUNGE - No executive lounge. (or at least that I know of) - They didn't mention it, so probably not.SPA/GYM - I didn't use the gym.Because I get complimentary WIFI as a Diamond member, during checkin, they told me to just enter my information and 'buy' the $14 wifi, and they said they would deduct it later. BUT they didn't, so I replied to the receipt e-mail, BUT no reply. E-mailed again, BUT no reply. So I ended up just going to the front desk and they said they would take it off. (that part was very smooth)PEOPLE, YOU HAVE TO CHECK YOUR RECEIPTS, I have been charged more than expected many times on my hilton stays... WHY 2 STARS?Because while in my room at around 4pm, a different hotel guest (stranger) walked in to my room!! APPARENTLY THE FRONT DESK GAVE THEM MY ROOM NUMBER FOR THEIR ROOM.OMG, now that was a first.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this hotel...I already have 3 - 4 more stays at this hotel this year, but considering changing all of them to a different hotel. (The Renwick is a lot better)"
"Amazing room, not great for views, but so comfy ....The doorman Jose was great, and helped us with getting aroundWell done Hilton!Might be worth getting premium wifi as the complementary wifi was poor"
"The room had all the basics and Hilton quality. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Location was excellent - near to many things: United Nations, Embassies, Grand Central Station, restaurants, etc. Smaller rooms than usual - but NYC has it's challenges!"
"Spent a saturday night in nyc at this location. Hotel is considered a historical location. Nice inside, but older as one would expect. Room was nice and staff was wonderful. Breakfast was ok and the main reason i went with 4 stars vs. 5. "
Room was prepaid in advance - got a view of window eye to eye next building. Very old and ac kicked on super loud - room seemed colder than thermostat was registering. Hotel was sold out so unable to move rooms.
"Great location for where I was doing business. Staff were all very nice and helpful. Facility was clean and maintained. Nice to have Valet parking. However, I was supposed to have WiFi in my room but it didn't work. The sound on the TV would cut in and out. Hot water would barely get hot at times. In all honesty I'm sure the staff would have corrected my issues if I had brought it to their attention. Since I was staying less than 24 hours, it didn't bother me and I didn't feel like changing rooms since I checked in fairly late (but the WiFi was a real issue for me)."
"Diamond HH member here, was charged a deposit on 13 June, checked out 17 June from Hilton Grand Central. A dozen emails assuring me ""great customer experience"" and hours on the phone, I still haven't been refunded the deposit. Hilton, the Guest Assistance File# 21028828. No more platitudes, just refund my deposit of US$400.42 to my credit card. Customers, beware. we have had the same problem with deposits not being refunded promptly from Hilton in Bangkok and Bangalore. Hilton--why are you requiring deposits from Diamond Club member anyway?"
"I had booked this Hilton Hotel in a great location close to all the mid-town attractions, and got an excellent deal. I got to the hotel very early and was told that my room wasn't ready (no great surprise, rarely would it be ready so early). I was told to come back a couple of hours later. So I left my suitcase with the concierge and headed out. I came back when they told me to, and was then informed that there was a ""problem with the linen"", and that the rooms would not be ready for some more time. There was then confusion about whether the official check-in time was 3 or 4 pm (my confirmation email said 3 pm, but the hotel insisted it was 4 pm). Okay, fine. I went out again, returned a couple of hours later--and was told yet again that the rooms were still not ready and that there were simply not enough staff to lay the linen! By now, lots of other guests were gathered angrily in the lobby, wondering exactly what was going on. This time, I was instructed by the front desk to go away and then try calling back after an hour or two. The wrong thing to say (it should always be the hotel's responsibility to call when the room is ready)--basic customer service!Anyway, after yet more back and forth, finally the room was ready well after 7pm. I had evening plans and was already getting late.I should mention that this was July 4th, so I initially thought that perhaps the holiday was to blame for the issue. I then found out that this same problem had occurred the day before, and I also saw it happen again the day after.I regularly stay at Hilton Hotels all over the world and have become a premium member. I was shocked that such chaos could happen at one of their hotels. A backwater hotel maybe, but not this worldwide brand!When I saw the front desk staff the next day--struggling with the same issues--I actually felt a bit sorry for them. They were powerless and had been landed in it. Facing angry customers as best they could and looking quite beleaguered, they almost appeared to have become numb to the flack they were receiving. But looking at things from customers' point of view, they had paid good money for the hotel, many had traveled from far and wide, and the least they could expect was to get their room on time. I sincerely hope that this situation was unique to the week I was there. Because if it's a regular state of affairs for this particular hotel, it would be unacceptable for a Hilton.The rest of my stay was okay. The other facilities including the hotel gym and the dining facilities served their purpose. However, things didn't really recover from the chaos of that first day..."
"Hotel maintenance staff should check rooms before arrival of guests. I asked for a mini fridge, was promised one but no one showed up. No one called me back to see why I was unsatisfied. I was promised a call back by the hotel manager but so far no one called to address the issue."
"I was extremely dissatisfied with the staff at this hotel. It was not up to the standards I expect from a Hilton hotel. Prior to arrival, we specifically requested and paid for a 2 bed room acceptable for 4 people. This was mentioned to the front desk, however the room we received was one with only a single king sized bed. A member of the security staff had to accompany us to our room and unlock the door as the card machine was not working. The security guard was very helpful after seeing the room would not accommodate us. He called the front desk from the unsuitable room, and after several minutes without response from the front desk, used his walkie-talkie to ask someone behind the desk to answer the phone. Only after he did this, did someone answer the call from the room phone. I feel this is absolutely inappropriate and speaks very poorly to the quality of service provided by the hotel's staff. Knowing that the front desk staff only answered the phone when asked by another member of staff left me feeling unimportant and undervalued as a customer. We were accommodated in a suite for the night - the suite only provided a single bed and a pullout couch. The pullout couch, however, had no sheets. When we asked the front desk to send some up, we were told they were out of them. What kind of hotel run out of sheets? This was more than a mere inconvenience, and made for an uncomfortable night for my family. I am also very disappointed in the housekeeping staff. Multiple times during our stay, we had to call housekeeping to send up extra bath towels; only 2 bath towels were provided in our room on these nights. The problem here lies with the fact that no one answered our calls, and even after leaving messages on their phone line we did not receive towels. Yet again, this was an inconvenience as we had to make calls to the front desk to receive them. Furthermore, on another day during our stay, we arrived in our room to find our room cleaned, but with no towels and shampoo/conditioner in our bathroom. The room would have been adequate had it not been for the putrid odour emanating from the carpets. We expressed this to the staff and asked them to deodorize the room. The room was relieved of the terrible scent for the day, however it returned the following day. Also, there was no hot water in our shower one evening during our stay, and the hairdryer smelled like it was burning hair. "
"We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights in August 2016. All of the staff were polite and courteous.The location is great, very close to Grand Central Terminal on 42nd Street.Our room was a little on the small side for 3 but was clean and tidy.Although we didn't eat in the hotel we did take a quick look at the prices which seemed very high."
You can't beat this location. The room was clean and affordable and the amenities (like fitness center) were pretty good. My room came with a sizable balcony I could use to rest my legs and take in the city. I really liked staying here and would do it again.
"Pros: quiet location, close to Grand Central Station, decent gym (2 ellipticals and 2 treadmills - quiet and emptyCons: older hotel and rooms - older pipes and electrical = running toilet and flickering lights, no mini fridge in the junior suite??, view of brick wall (17th floor)It's ok if you're not going to be in the room much. Wait to book for better deal. "
"Stayed at this hotel for four nights in July. The room we were in was pretty small with not much space. Hotel walls are pretty thin as we could here next door showering and others talking. The room was however clean and bedding good. Staff very good and very helpful. It is ideally placed for Grand Central, the United Nations, Chrysler Building and Times Square. There's a great garden pub just round the corner in 2nd Avenue too!"
"The Hilton New York Grand Central is a wonderful, small hotel a few blocks from Grand Central Station. The service at the front desk was very fast and cordial. The room was very comfortable and spotless. We will definitely stay there again!"
"If you book through a travel site, beware of hidden ""incidental"" fees. They charged me a $100 fee when checking in, which i then had to put on a separate card because no one warned me. Supposed to be refunded it, but have yet to get it back on my card. If not there by Wednesday I will be calling to fight it.The room was lovely, though no view to speak of. The air conditioning was a blessing in the heat of the day. Bed felt a bit small for a queen, but it worked and was comfy. Avoided the restaurant because the prices were obscene for such a small place. Elevators are a tight squeeze, and not very secure because one of the cameras was obviously disconnected. I would say that while they were in the same side of town as Grand Central Terminal, it is a bit of a hike with luggage, so plan on taking a cab or the 42 bus from the terminal to the hotel (the bus stops right in front of the hotel)."
Small nicely kept boutique hotel nicely maintained. Friendly helpful doormen. Breakfast was not worth the money . Tiny rooms (FYI) close to Grznd Central Station. I would recommend if you're looking for a reasonably priced hotel that you will not be spending a lot of time in. The king standard room is small . 
"If you are staying in NYC you shouldn't expect big rooms, unless you are paying for a suite. Check in process was fast despite the fact of people waiting Room was small, however it was very clean. Staff was friendly and helpful, specially when a cab was needed.Favorite hotel in the East area. "
Great area for restaurants. Take advantage of tours at Grand Central and NYC library. Hotel had complicated shower instructions. Skip expensive breakfast at hotel and go on 2nd Avenue for nice cheap breakfast. 
Rooms were not ready for any of the guests due to an issue with linens not being delivered . Staff was stressed out and not very helpful . Room small for price . Bed uncomfortable. List is tooo long to continue find another hotel .
"My partner and I were traveling from Seattle just for the day to New York for the fourth and we checked at 7am and were told by first concierge to come back at 1pm because our room wasn't ready quite yet, which was understandable.We came back at 5pm & the manager told us bluntly without taking/asking for our names that our room still wasn't ready. We explained that we had already checked in and we have been waiting for our confirmed room for 11 hours. She said that the company responsible for bringing linens was stuck in the holiday traffic and were running behind schedule. We hadn't showered/slept in 30hrs & were in desperate need of rest so she let us use the fitness center showers gave us no towels and had no idea where the fitness center was when she directed us there. So we had all our luggage in the fitness center for one hour trying to make calls for re-booking as we were leaving the next day. We go back downstairs and another concierge tells us that our room has actually been ready and when we asked why the manager said it wasn't, she replied with ""I honestly don't know."" Next morning when we asked for some sort of compensation/voucher because of the trouble she put us in she said we don't do that because you booked through a third party, yet regardless we are still customers of the hotel. We were not the only unsatisfied customers that night. Safe to say I will not be booking this hotel in the future."
Hotel staff told us our room was not ready at 3PM and said to wait half an hour which turned into waiting for 5 to 6 hours just to get our room at 8PM or 9PM.On top of this there was a mechanical sound not sure coming from where but every 30 mins it sounded like someone was breaking into the room so not only did I wait for 5 to 6 hours for my room I didn't even get to sleep well =/. Very disappointed I don't think I want to ever stay at Hilton again.
